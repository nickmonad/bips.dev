<p>A block that had a larger number of total transaction inputs than
previously seen was mined and broadcasted. Bitcoin 0.8 nodes were able
to handle this, but some pre-0.8 Bitcoin nodes rejected it, causing an
unexpected fork of the blockchain. The pre-0.8-incompatible chain (from
here on, the 0.8 chain) at that point had around 60% of the mining hash
power ensuring the split did not automatically resolve (as would have
occurred if the pre-0.8 chain outpaced the 0.8 chain in total work,
forcing 0.8 nodes to reorganise to the pre-0.8 chain).</p>
<p>In order to restore a canonical chain as soon as possible, BTCGuild and
Slush downgraded their Bitcoin 0.8 nodes to 0.7 so their pools would
also reject the larger block. This placed majority hashpower on the
chain without the larger block, thus eventually causing the 0.8 nodes to
reorganise to the pre-0.8 chain.</p>
<p>During this time there was at least <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=152348.0">one large double
spend</a>. However, it
was done by someone experimenting to see if it was possible and was not
intended to be malicious.</p>
<h2 id="what-went-right">What went right</h2>
<ul>
<li>The split was detected very quickly.</li>
<li>The right people were online and available in IRC or could be
contacted directly.</li>
<li>Marek Palatinus (Slush) and Michael Marsee (Eleuthria of BTCGuild)
quickly downgraded their nodes to restore a pre-0.8 chain as
canonical, despite the fact that this caused them to sacrifice
significant amounts of money.</li>
<li>Deposits to the major exchanges and payments via BitPay were also
suspended (and then un-suspended) very quickly.</li>
<li>Fortunately, the only attack on a merchant was done by someone who
was not intending to actually steal money.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="root-cause">Root cause</h2>
<p>Bitcoin versions prior to 0.8 configure an insufficient number of
Berkeley DB locks to process large but otherwise valid blocks. Berkeley
DB locks have to be manually configured by API users depending on
anticipated load. The manual says this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The recommended algorithm for selecting the maximum number of locks,
lockers, and lock objects is to run the application under stressful
conditions and then review the lock system's statistics to determine
the maximum number of locks, lockers, and lock objects that were
used. Then, double these values for safety.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the insufficiently high BDB lock configuration, it implicitly had
become a network consensus rule determining block validity (albeit an
inconsistent and unsafe rule, since the lock usage could vary from node
to node).</p>
<p>Because max-sized blocks had been successfully processed on the testnet,
it did not occur to anyone that there could be blocks that were smaller
but require more locks than were available. Prior to 0.7 unmodified
mining nodes self-imposed a maximum block size of 500,000 bytes, which
further prevented this case from being triggered. 0.7 made the target
size configurable and miners had been encouraged to increase this target
in the week prior to the incident.</p>
<p>Bitcoin 0.8 did not use Berkeley DB. It switched to LevelDB instead,
which did not implement the same locking limits as BDB. Therefore it was
able to process the forking block successfully.</p>
<p>Note that BDB locks are also required during processing of
re-organizations. Versions prior to 0.8 may be unable to process some
valid re-orgs.</p>
<p>This would be an issue even if the entire network was running version
0.7.2. It is theoretically possible for one 0.7.2 node to create a block
that others are unable to validate, or for 0.7.2 nodes to create block
re-orgs that peers cannot validate, because the contents of each node's
blkindex.dat database is not identical, and the number of locks required
depends on the exact arrangement of the blkindex.dat on disk (locks are
acquired per-page).</p>
<h2 id="action-items">Action items</h2>
<h3 id="immediately">Immediately</h3>
<p><strong>Done</strong>: Release a version 0.8.1, forked directly from 0.8.0, that, for
the next two months has the following new rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reject blocks that would probably cause more than 10,000 locks to be
taken.</li>
<li>Limit the maximum block-size created to 500,000 bytes</li>
<li>Release a patch for older versions that implements the same rules,
but also increases the maximum number of locks to 537,000</li>
<li>Create a web page on bitcoin.org that will urge users to upgrade to
0.8.1, but will tell them how to set DB_CONFIG to 537,000 locks if
they absolutely cannot.</li>
<li>Over the next 2 months, send a series of alerts to users of older
versions, pointing to the web page.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="alert-system">Alert system</h3>
<p><strong>Done</strong>: Review who has access to the alert system keys, make sure they
all have contact information for each other, and get good timezone
overlap by people with access to the keys.</p>
<p><strong>Done</strong>: Implement a new bitcoind feature so services can get timely
notification of alerts: -alertnotify=<command> Run command when an
AppliesToMe() alert is received.</p>
<p><strong>Done</strong>: Pre-generate 52 test alerts, and set a time every week when
they are broadcast on -testnet (so -alertnotify scripts can be tested in
as-close-to-real-world conditions as possible).</p>
<p>Idea from Michael Gronager: encourage merchants/exchanges (and maybe
pools) to run new code behind a bitcoind running the network-majority
version.</p>
<h3 id="safe-mode">Safe mode</h3>
<p><strong>Done</strong>: Perhaps trigger an alert if there is a long enough side chain
detected, even if it is not the main chain. Pools could use this to
automatically suspend payouts if a long side-chain suddenly appeared out
of nowhere (it’s hard for an attacker to mine such a thing).</p>
<h3 id="testing">Testing</h3>
<p>Start running bots on the testnet that grab some coins from a testnet
faucet, generate large numbers of random transactions that
split/recombine them and then send them back to the faucet. Randomized
online testing on the testnet might have revealed the pathological block
type earlier.</p>
<h3 id="double-spending">Double spending</h3>
<p>A double spend attack was successful, despite that both sides of the
chain heard about the transactions in the same order. The reason is most
likely that the memory pools were cleared when the mining pool nodes
were downgraded. A solution is for nodes to sync their mempools to each
other at startup, however, this requires a memory pool expiry policy to
be implemented as currently node restarts are the only way for
unconfirmed transactions to be evicted from the system.</p>
<h3 id="resolution">Resolution</h3>
<p>On 16 August, 2013 block 252,451
(0x0000000000000024b58eeb1134432f00497a6a860412996e7a260f47126eed07) was
accepted by the main network, forking unpatched nodes off the network.</p>
