<p>This BIP describes a script for generalized debt agreement contract
based on Hashed Time-Lock Contract (BIP 199) transactions according to
the Atomic Loans specification (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.05117.pdf).

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>A Hashed Time-Locked Collateral Contract (HTLCC) consists of two scripts
that permit a designated party (the &quot;borrower&quot;) to lock funds on the
Bitcoin chain for a specified amount of time as collateral in a debt
agreement where the loan principal is denominated in a currency on
another blockchain. We denote the blockchain on which the loan principal
is issued the principal blockchain.</p>
<p>The purpose of each script is to enable the creation of a debt agreement
between two parties (the &quot;borrower&quot; and the &quot;lender&quot;), where the
collateral is locked in a P2SH, and can only be spent once the borrower
repays the principal and interest in the debt agreement on the principal
blockchain. In the case that the borrower does not repay, the borrower
or lender can opt for liquidation of the collateral, which will involve
the atomic swapping of collateral for the loan currency. In the case
that at least one of the two parties don't opt for liquidation, then
each party will be entitled to a percentage of the collateral, decided
when the funds are initially locked in the P2SH.</p>
<p>These funds are locked into two scripts. Refundable Collateral and
Seizable Collateral scripts. The funds sent to these scripts represent
the percentage of collateral that each party is entitled to in the case
that repayment fails, and the parties don't opt for liquidation.</p>
<p>The Refundable Collateral script takes the following form:</p>
<p><code>   OP_IF</code><br />
<code>       OP_SIZE </code><secret b2 length><code> OP_EQUALVERIFY [HASHOP] </code><secret hash b2><code> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_DUP OP_HASH160 </code><borrower pubkey hash><code> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG</code><br />
<code>   OP_ELSE</code><br />
<code>       OP_IF</code><br />
<code>           </code><loan expiration num><code> [TIMEOUTOP] OP_DROP OP_SIZE OP_PUSHDATA(1) </code><secret a2 length><code> OP_EQUALVERIFY [HASHOP] </code><secret hash a2><code> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_SIZE </code><secret b3 length><code> OP_EQUALVERIFY [HASHOP] </code><secret hash b3><code> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_2 </code><borrower pubkey><code> </code><lender pubkey><code> OP_2 OP_CHECKMULTISIG</code><br />
<code>       OP_ELSE</code><br />
<code>           </code><liquidation expiration num><code> [TIMEOUTOP] OP_DROP OP_DUP OP_HASH160 </code><borrower pubkey hash><code> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG</code><br />
<code>       OP_ENDIF</code><br />
<code>   OP_ENDIF</code></p>
<p>The Seizable Collateral script takes the following form:</p>
<p><code>   OP_IF</code><br />
<code>       OP_SIZE </code><secret b2 length><code> OP_EQUALVERIFY [HASHOP] </code><secret hash b2><code> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_DUP OP_HASH160 </code><borrower pubkey hash><code> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG</code><br />
<code>   OP_ELSE</code><br />
<code>       OP_IF</code><br />

<h3 id="interaction">Interaction</h3>
<ul>
<li>Alice (the &quot;borrower&quot;) and Bob (the &quot;lender&quot;) exchange public keys
as well as two secret hashes A1, A2 created by Alice and three
hashes B1, B2, B3 created by Bob. They then mutually agree upon a
timeout threshold for the Loan Period, Liquidation Period, and
Seizure Period. Alice constructs the script and P2SH address for the
Refundable Collateral Contract and Seizable Collateral Contract. Bob
constructs the script for the blockchain on which the loan principal
will be issued - the principal blockchain.</li>
</ul>
<!-- end list -->
<ul>
<li>Bob sends loan principal funds to the loan script on the principal
blockchain</li>
</ul>
<!-- end list -->
<ul>
<li>Alice sends funds to the Refundable Collateral P2SH address and the
Seizable Collateral P2SH address. The amount of funds she sends to
the two addresses will be determined beforehand off-chain between
Alice and Bob.</li>
</ul>
<!-- end list -->
<ul>
<li>Either
<ul>
<li>Bob accepts locking of collateral by Alice and reveals B1,
allowing Alice to withdraw the loan amount on the principal
blockchain.</li>
<li>Bob doesn't accept locking of collateral by Alice, and recovers
the funds after the approve expiration while revealing B2, which
allows Alice to refund the Refundable and Seizable collateral.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- end list -->
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>If Bob accepts the locking of collateral by Alice</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- end list -->
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Either
<ul>
<li>Alice repays the loan by the end of the Loan Period and Bob
reveals the secret to Alice by revealing it in the loan
repayment acceptance transaction; OR</li>
<li>Alice defaults on the loan and Alice and Bob both opt for
collateral liquidation, where any third-party is able to bid
on the collateral. The winning bidder, Charlie, will
subsequently receive the liquidated collateral by way of an
Atomic Swap between the collateral funds (ie. BTC locked in
both the Refundable Collateral P2SH and the Seizable
Collateral P2SH) and the bid funds (ie. funds denominated in
the loan currency, put forth by Charlie as part of his bid).
This is done by both Alice and Bob signing a multisig and
revealing A2 and B2; OR</li>
<li>Alice defaults on the loan and at least one of Alice or Bob
opts out of collateral liquidation, then Alice recovers the
Refundable Collateral funds and Bob spends the Seizable
Collateral funds.</li>
<li>Alice defaults on the loan and at least one of Alice or Bob
opts out of collateral liquidation. But Bob doesn't spend
the Seizable Collateral funds, so Alice recovers both the
Refundable Collateral funds and the Seizable Collateral
funds.</li>

<h2 id="compatibility">Compatibility</h2>
<p>BIP 197 is compatible with [ERC
1850](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/1850) for [atomic
loans](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.05117.pdf) with Ethereum. Can be
extended in the future to be compatible with other HTLC and smart
contract compatible chains.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>In many different protocols, the revealing of secrets is used as a
settlement mechanism. HTLCC transactions are a safe way of exchanging
secrets to advance the state of a debt agreement, due to the ability to
recover a percentage of collateral funds from an uncooperative
counterparty, and ensure principal + interest + liquidation fee is paid
with a cooperative party.</p>
<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>
<p>borrower: entity that locks collateral on the Bitcoin chain and receives
loan amount on principal blockchain from lender following the approval
of the borrower’s borrow request</p>
<p>lender: entity that contributes funds to the Hashed Time-Locked
Principal Contract (HTLPC) on the principal blockchain, to be borrowed
by the borrower upon the locking of collateral on the Bitcoin chain and
the lender’s approval</p>
<p>repay: when the borrower pays back the principal + interest before
loanExpiration</p>
<p>default: when the borrower fails to pay back the principal + interest
before the loanExpiration</p>
<p>secret: random number chosen by the borrower or lender, revealed to
allow the parties to change the state of the debt agreement</p>
<p>secretHash: hash of the secret, used in the construction of HTLCC</p>
<p>SecretA1: secret generated by the borrower, used to prove that the
borrower has withdrawn the loan</p>
<p>SecretA2: secret generated by the borrower, used to allow the bidder to
withdraw the liquidated collateral funds</p>
<p>SecretB1: secret generated by the lender, used to accept the locking of
collateral by borrower, enabling borrower to withdraw the loan amount</p>
<p>SecretB2: secret generated by the lender, used to refund themselves in
the event they aren't satisfied with borrower’slocking of collateral.
Also used to accept borrower’s repayment of principal plus interest</p>
<p>SecretB3: secret generated by the lender, used to allow the bidder to
withdraw the liquidated collateral funds</p>
<p>SecretC: secret generated by the bidder, used to accept the signatures
of the borrower and lender for authorizing the liquidation of collateral</p>
<p>loan expiration num: timestamp before which the borrower must repay the
loan; or otherwise risk the liquidation or seizure of their collateral</p>
<p>bidding expiration num: timestamp that determines the amount of time
allocated to bidding before seizure period occurs</p>
<p>seizure expiration num: timestamp that determines the amount of time
during which the lender can seize funds within the Seizable Collateral
P2SH, after which the borrower can refund their corresponding amount of
the collateral they are entitled to (ie. either just the funds within
the Refundable Collateral P2SH, or both the Refundable Collateral and
Seizable Collateral in the event where the lender failed to seize).</p>
<h3 id="approve-period">Approve Period</h3>
<p>During this time, the lender deploys the HTLPC on the principal
blockchain. Following this, the borrower locks their collateral on the
Bitcoin blockchain in a HTLCC. The lender then either reveals secretB1
to signify that they are satisfied with the collateral, and the borrower
can withdraw the loan by revealing secretA1. If the lender is not
satisfied with the collateral locked by the borrower, the lender can
refunds their loan amount by revealing secretB2, which will subsequently
allow the borrower to refund the collateral amount they deposited.</p>
<h3 id="loan-period">Loan Period</h3>
<p>Once the borrower has withdrawn the loan amount, the Loan Period begins.
Once the Loan Period is finished, the borrower is expected to repay the
loan. If they do, the lender can then accept the repayment by revealing
secretB2, enabling the borrower to refund their collateral amount. In
the case that the borrower defaults or does not repay the full principal
plus interest amount, the lender can choose to not accept the loan
repayment, and the parties can opt for liquidation of the collateral in
the Bidding Period.</p>
<h3 id="bidding-period">Bidding Period</h3>
<p>In the case of a default or the lender not accepting the borrower
repayment, the lender and borrower can opt for liquidation of the
collateral through the process of third party bidders bidding on the
collateral. The Bidding Period can be initiated by either the lender or
the borrower. Once the bidding timeout occurs, the lender and borrower
must each provide a signature, followed by secretC revealed by the
winning bidder once they have checked that the signature is proper.
Finally, the lender and borrower must each reveal secretA2 and secretB3
to allow the collateral to be withdrawn by the winning bidder.</p>
<h3 id="seizure-period">Seizure Period</h3>
<p>In the case that either the lender or borrower don’t accept the bid, the
lender can seize a percentage of the collateral. The amount is dependent
on the amount of collateral locked in the Seizable Collateral and
Refundable Collateral script as described in this BIP. During this
period, the borrower can also refund the funds locked in the Refundable
Collateral script.</p>
<h3 id="refund-period">Refund Period</h3>
<p>In the case that the lender does not seize the collateral locked in the
Seizable Collateral script, then the borrower can refund the funds
locked in the Seizable Collateral script.</p>
<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>The rational for the following script checking the length of secrets
pushed to the stack that are used with OP_SHA256 in the following
script</p>
<p><code> OP_SIZE </code><secret b2 length><code> OP_EQUALVERIFY</code></p>
<p>is to ensure that the secret size is exactly a certain number of bytes
long.</p>
<p>This is especially important when this script is used alongside the
HTLPC on other chains like Ethereum where the sha256 opcode only takes
up 32 bytes and disregards the rest, there is a need to ensure that the
length on the Bitcoin side is 32 bytes.</p>
<h2 id="backwards-compatibility">Backwards Compatibility</h2>
<p>As this is a new standard for collateralized debt, there is no need for
backward compatibility. Once this is accepted as a standard there are
certain aspects of the contract that can be modified while still
retaining backwards compatibility, such as removing the need to verify
the size of the hash if being used with two blockchains with the same
maximum block size, which would be backward compatible with the current
script.</p>
