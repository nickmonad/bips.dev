<h2 id="Abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This <em>Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP)</em> provides information about the preparation of BIPs and policies relating to
the publication of BIPs. It replaces <a href="https://bips.dev/3/bip-0002.mediawiki">BIP 2</a> with a streamlined process, and may be amended to
address the evolving needs of the BIP process.</p>
<h2 id="Motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>BIP 2 was written in 2016.
This BIP revisits aspects of the BIP 2 process
that did not achieve broad adoption, reduces the judgment calls assigned to the BIP Editor role, delineates the
BIP types more clearly, and generalizes the BIP process to fit the community’s use of the repository.</p>
<h2 id="Fundamentals">Fundamentals</h2>
<h3 id="What_is_a_BIP?">What is a BIP?</h3>
<p>BIPs are improvement proposals for Bitcoin<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#capitalization">1</a></sup>. The main topic is information and technologies that support and expand the utility of the bitcoin
currency. Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.
Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.,
<a href="https://bips.dev/3/bip-0050.mediawiki">BIP 50</a>), or other information relevant to the Bitcoin community. However, any topics related to
the Bitcoin protocol, peer-to-peer network, and client software may be acceptable.</p>
<p>BIPs are intended to be a means for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and
documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. A BIP may be submitted by anyone,
provided it is the original work of its authors and the content is of high quality, e.g. does not waste
the community's time. No content may be generated by AI/LLMs and authors must proactively disclose
up-front any use of AI/LLMs.</p>
<p>The scope of the BIPs
repository is limited to BIPs that do not oppose the fundamental principle that Bitcoin constitutes a peer-to-peer
electronic cash system for the bitcoin currency.</p>
<h3 id="BIP_Ownership">BIP Ownership</h3>
<p>Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authors’ opinion or recommendation. The authors are
expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of
their proposal within the Bitcoin community. As a BIP progresses through the workflow, it becomes increasingly
co-owned by the Bitcoin community.</p>
<h4 id="Authors_and_Deputies">Authors and Deputies</h4>
<p>Authors may want additional help with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign
one or more Deputies to their BIP. Deputies are stand-in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the
document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as a point of contact for the BIP in the absence of the
authors. Deputies may perform the role of Authors for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.
Deputies share ownership of the BIP at the discretion of the Authors.</p>
<h3 id="What_is_the_Significance_of_BIPs?">What is the Significance of BIPs?</h3>
<p>BIPs do not define what Bitcoin is: individual BIPs do not represent Bitcoin community consensus or a general
recommendation for implementation. A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the Bitcoin
community. Some BIPs may never be adopted. Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more Bitcoin clients or other related
software. Some may even end up changing the consensus rules that the Bitcoin ecosystem jointly enforces.</p>
<h3 id="What_is_the_Purpose_of_the_BIPs_Repository?">What is the Purpose of the BIPs Repository?</h3>
<p>The <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/">BIPs repository</a> serves as a publication medium and archive for mature proposals.
Through its high visibility, it facilitates the community-wide consideration of BIPs and provides a well-established
source to retrieve the latest version of any BIP. The repository transparently records all changes to each BIP and
allows any community member to retain a complete copy of the archive easily.</p>
<p>The BIPs repository neither tracks community sentiment<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#acceptance">2</a></sup> nor ecosystem adoption<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#adoption">3</a></sup> of BIPs beyond
the brief overview provided via the BIP status (see <a href="https://bips.dev/3/#workflow">Workflow</a> below).
Proposals are published in this repository if they are on-topic and fulfill the editorial criteria.
No formal or informal decision body governs Bitcoin development or decides adoption of BIPs.</p>
<h2 id="BIP_Format_and_Structure">BIP Format and Structure</h2>
<h3 id="Specification">Specification</h3>
<p>Authors may choose to submit BIPs in MediaWiki or Markdown<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#markdown">4</a></sup> format.</p>
<p>Each BIP must have a <em>Preamble</em>, an <em>Abstract</em>, a <em>Copyright</em>, and a <em>Motivation</em> section. Authors should consider all issues in the
following list and address each as appropriate.</p>
<ul>
<li>Preamble — Headers containing metadata about the BIP (see the section <a href="https://bips.dev/3/#bip-header-preamble">BIP Header Preamble</a>
below).</li>
<li>Abstract — A short description of the issue being addressed.</li>
<li>Motivation — Why is this BIP being written? Clearly explain how the existing situation presents a problem and why the proposed idea resolves the
issue or improves upon the current situation.</li>
<li>Specification — The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The
specification should be detailed enough to enable any Bitcoin project to create an interoperable implementation.</li>
<li>Rationale — The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what inspired the design and why particular
design decisions were made. It should describe related work and alternate designs that were considered. The rationale
should record relevant objections or important concerns that were raised and addressed as this proposal was developed.</li>
<li>Backward Compatibility — Any BIP that introduces incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity as well as provide instructions on how
implementers and users should deal with these incompatibilities.</li>
<li>Reference Implementation — Where applicable, a reference implementation, test vectors, and documentation must be
finished before the BIP can be given the status &quot;Complete&quot;. Test vectors must be provided in the BIP or
as auxiliary files (see <a href="https://bips.dev/3/#auxiliary-files">Auxiliary Files</a>) under an acceptable license. The reference implementation can be provided in the BIP, as an auxiliary file, or per reference to a pull request that is expected to remain available permanently.</li>
<li>Changelog — A section to track modifications to a BIP after reaching Complete status.</li>
<li>Copyright — The BIP must be placed under an acceptable license (see <a href="https://bips.dev/3/#bip-licensing">BIP Licensing</a> below).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="BIP_Header_Preamble">BIP Header Preamble</h4>
<p>Each BIP must begin with an <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/">RFC 822-style header preamble</a>. The headers must
appear in the following order. Headers marked with &quot;*&quot; are optional. All other headers are required.</p>
<h5 id="Overview">Overview</h5>

</li>
<li>
<p>Assigned – The date a BIP was assigned its number. Please use &quot;?&quot; before a number has been assigned by the BIP Editors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>License — The License header specifies SPDX License Expressions describing the terms under which the
BIP and its auxiliary files are available. See the <a href="https://bips.dev/3/#bip-licensing">BIP Licensing</a> section below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discussion — The Discussion header points the audience to relevant discussions of the BIP, e.g., the mailing list
thread in which the idea for the BIP was discussed, a thread where a new version of the BIP was presented, or relevant
discussion threads on other platforms. Entries take the format &quot;yyyy-mm-dd: URL&quot;, e.g., <code>2009-01-09: https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg10142.html</code>, using the date and URL of the start of the
conversation. Multiple discussions should be listed on separate lines.</p>

potential successor BIP.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Auxiliary_Files">Auxiliary Files</h4>
<p>BIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams and source code. Auxiliary files must be included in a subdirectory
for that BIP named <code>bip-XXXX</code>, where &quot;XXXX&quot; is the BIP number zero-padded to four digits. File names in the subdirectory
do not need to adhere to a specific convention.</p>
<h3 id="BIP_Types">BIP Types</h3>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>Specification BIP</strong> defines a set of technical rules describing a new feature or affecting the interoperability of implementations. The
distinguishing characteristic of a Specification BIP is that it can be implemented, and implementations can be compliant with
it. Specification BIPs must have a Specification section, must have a Backward Compatibility section (if incompatibilities are introduced), and can only be advanced to Complete after they contain or refer to a reference implementation and test vectors.</li>
<li>An <strong>Informational BIP</strong> describes a Bitcoin design issue, or provides general guidelines or other information to the
Bitcoin community.</li>
<li>A <strong>Process BIP</strong> describes a process surrounding Bitcoin, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process
BIPs are like Specification BIPs, but apply to topics other than the Bitcoin protocol and Bitcoin implementations.
They often require community consensus and are typically binding for the corresponding process. Examples include
procedures, guidelines, and changes to decision-making processes such as the BIP process.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Workflow">Workflow</h2>
<p>The BIP process starts with a new idea for Bitcoin. Each potential BIP must have authors—people who write the BIP,
gather feedback, shepherd the discussion in the appropriate forums, and finally recommend a mature proposal to the
community.</p>
<p><img src="https://bips.dev/3/bip-0003/status-diagram.png" alt="Status Diagram" title="Status Diagram for the BIP Workflow" /></p>
<h3 id="Ideation">Ideation</h3>
<p>After having an idea, the authors should evaluate whether it meets the criteria to become a BIP, as described in this
BIP. The idea must be of interest to the broader community or relevant to multiple software projects. Minor improvements
and matters concerning only a single project usually do not require standardization and should instead be brought up directly to
the relevant project.</p>
<p>The authors should first research whether their idea has been considered before. Ideas in Bitcoin are often rediscovered,
and prior related discussions may inform the authors of the issues that may arise in its progression. After some investigation,
the novelty and viability of the idea should be tested by posting about the idea to the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev">Bitcoin Development Mailing
List</a>. Prior correspondence can be found in the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/">mailing list
archive</a>.</p>
<p>It is recommended that authors establish before or at the start of working on a draft whether their idea may be of
interest to the Bitcoin community.
Authors should avoid opening a pull request with a BIP draft out of the blue.
Vetting an idea publicly before investing time and effort to formally describe the idea is meant to save time for both the authors and
the community. Not only may someone point out relevant discussion topics that were missed in the authors’
research, or that an idea is guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions, but describing an idea publicly also
tests whether it is of interest to more people beside the authors.</p>
<p>As a first sketch of the proposal is taking shape, the authors should present it to the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev">Bitcoin Development Mailing
List</a>. This gives the authors a chance to collect initial feedback and address
fundamental concerns. If the authors wish to work in public on the proposal at this stage, it is recommended that they
open a pull request against one of their forks of the BIPs repository instead of the main BIPs repository.</p>
<p>It is recommended that complicated proposals be split into separate BIPs that each focus on a specific component of the
overall proposal.</p>
<h3 id="Progression_through_BIP_Statuses">Progression through BIP Statuses</h3>
<p>The following sections refer to BIP Status field values. The BIP Status field is defined in the Header Preamble
specification above.</p>
<h4 id="Draft">Draft</h4>
<p>After fleshing out the proposal further and ensuring that it is of high quality and properly formatted, the authors
should open a pull request to the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips">BIPs repository</a>. The document must adhere to the
formatting requirements specified above and should be provided as a file named with a working title of the form
&quot;bip-title.[md|mediawiki]&quot;. The authors must not self-assign a number to their proposal.</p>
<p>BIPs that (1) adhere to the formatting requirements, (2) are on-topic, and (3) have materially progressed beyond the
ideation phase, e.g., by generating substantial public discussion and commentary from diverse contributors, by
independent Bitcoin projects working on adopting the proposal, or by the authors working for an extended period toward
improving the proposal based on community feedback, will be assigned a number by a BIP Editor. The BIP Editors should
not assign a number when they perceive a proposal being met with lack of interest: number assignment facilitates the
distributed discussion of ideas, but before a proposal garners some interest in the Bitcoin community, there is no need
to refer to it by a number.</p>
<p>Proposals are also not ready for number assignment if they duplicate efforts, disregard formatting rules, are too
unfocused or too broad, fail to provide proper motivation, fail to address backward compatibility where necessary, or
fail to specify the feature clearly and comprehensively. Reviewers and BIP Editors should provide guidance on how the
proposal may be improved to progress toward readiness. Pull requests that are proposing off-topic ideas or
have stopped making progress may be closed.</p>
<p>When the proposal is ready and has been assigned a number, a BIP Editor will merge it into the BIPs repository. After the
BIP has been merged to the repository, its main focus should no longer shift significantly, even while the authors may
continue to update the proposal as necessary. Updates to merged documents by the authors should also be submitted as
pull requests.</p>
<h4 id="Complete">Complete<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#complete">7</a></sup></h4>
<p>When the authors have concluded all planned work on their proposal, are confident that their BIP represents a net
improvement, is clear, comprehensive, and is
ready for adoption by the Bitcoin community, they may update the BIP’s status to Complete to indicate that they
recommend adoption, implementation, or deployment of the BIP. Where applicable, the authors must ensure that any
proposed specification is solid, not unduly complicated, and definitive. Specification BIPs must come with or refer to a working reference implementation and comprehensive test vectors before they can be moved to Complete. Subsequently, the BIP’s content should only be
adjusted in minor details, e.g., to improve language, clarify ambiguities, backfill omissions in the specification, add
test vectors for edge cases, or address other issues discovered as the BIP is being adopted.</p>
<p>A Complete BIP can only move to Deployed or Closed. Any necessary changes to the specification should be minimal and
interfere as little as possible with ongoing adoption. If a Complete BIP is found to need substantial functional
changes, it may be preferable to move it to Closed<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#new-BIP">8</a></sup>, and to start a new BIP with the changes instead.
Otherwise, it could cause confusion as to what being compliant with the BIP means.</p>
<p>A BIP may remain in the Complete status indefinitely unless its authors or deputies decide to move it to Closed or it is advanced to
Deployed.
Complete is the final status for most successful Informational BIPs.</p>
<h4 id="Deployed">Deployed</h4>
<p>A Complete BIP should only be moved to Deployed once it is settled: after its approach has solidified, its
Specification has been put through its paces, feedback from early adopters has been processed, and amendments to the BIP have stopped.
Then, a BIP may be advanced to Deployed upon request by any community member with evidence<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#evidence">9</a></sup> that
the BIP is in active use. Convincing evidence includes for example: an established project having deployed support
for the BIP in mainnet software releases, a soft fork proposal’s activation criteria having been met on the network, or
rough consensus for the BIP having been demonstrated.</p>
<p>Once Deployed, the BIP is considered final.
Any modifications to the BIP beyond bug fixes, other minor amendments, additions to the test vectors, or editorial
changes should be avoided.
Any breaking changes to the BIP’s Specification should be proposed as a new separate BIP.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#new-BIP">8</a></sup></p>
<h5 id="Process_BIPs">Process BIPs</h5>
<p>A Process BIP may change status from Complete to Deployed when it achieves rough consensus on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List. A
proposal is said to have rough consensus if its advancement has been open to discussion on the mailing list for at least
one month, the discussion achieved meaningful engagement, and no person maintains any unaddressed substantiated objections to it. Addressed or obstructive objections
may be ignored/overruled by general agreement that they have been sufficiently addressed, but clear reasoning must be
given in such circumstances. Deployed Process BIPs may be modified indefinitely as long as a proposed modification has
rough consensus per the same criteria.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#living-documents">10</a></sup></p>
<h4 id="Closed">Closed<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#closed">11</a></sup></h4>
<p>A BIP that is of historical interest only, and is not being actively worked on, promoted or in active use, should be
marked as Closed. The reason for moving the
proposal to (or from) Closed should be recorded in the Changelog section in the same commit that updates the status.
BIPs do not get deleted, they are retained even after being updated to Closed.
Transitions involving the Closed state are:</p>
<h5 id="Draft_↦_Closed">Draft ↦ Closed</h5>
<p>BIP authors may decide on their own to change their BIP’s status from Draft to Closed. If a Draft BIP stops making
progress, sees accumulated feedback unaddressed, or otherwise appears stalled for a year, anyone may propose the BIP
status be updated to Closed. The BIP is then updated to Closed unless the authors assert that they intend to continue work within four weeks of being contacted.</p>
<h5 id="Complete_↦_Closed">Complete ↦ Closed</h5>
<p>BIPs that had attained the Complete status, i.e., that had been recommended for adoption, may be moved to Closed per the
authors’ announcement to the Bitcoin Development Mailing List<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#bip-announcements-to-list">12</a></sup>. However, if someone volunteers to adopt the proposal
within four weeks, they become the BIP's author or deputy (see <a href="https://bips.dev/3/#transferring-bip-ownership">Transferring BIP Ownership</a> below), and the BIP will
remain Complete instead.</p>
<h5 id="Deployed_↦_Closed">Deployed ↦ Closed</h5>
<p>A BIP may evolve from Deployed to Closed when it is no longer in active use. Any community member may initiate this
Status update by announcing it to the mailing list<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#bip-announcements-to-list">12</a></sup>, and proceed if no objections have been raised for four weeks.</p>
<h5 id="Closed_↦_Draft">Closed ↦ Draft</h5>
<p>The Closed status is generally intended to be a final status for BIPs,
and if BIP authors decide to make another attempt at a previously Closed BIP, it is generally recommended to create a new
proposal. (Obviously, the authors may borrow any amount of inspiration or actual text from any prior BIPs as licensing
permits.) The authors should take special care to address the issues that caused the prior attempt’s abandonment. Even
if the prior attempt had been assigned a number, the new BIP will generally be assigned a distinct number. However, if it is
obvious that the new attempt directly continues work on the same idea, it may be reasonable to return the
Closed BIP to Draft status.</p>
<h3 id="Changelog">Changelog</h3>
<p>To help implementers understand updates to a BIP, any changes after it has reached Complete must be tracked with version,
date, and description in a Changelog section sorted by most recent version first. The version number is inspired by semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).
The MAJOR version is incremented if changes to the BIP’s Specification are introduced that are incompatible with prior
versions (which should be rare after a BIP is Complete, and only happen in well-grounded exceptional cases to a BIP that
is Deployed). The MINOR version is incremented whenever the specification of the BIP is changed or extended in a
backward-compatible way. The PATCH version is incremented for other changes to the BIP that are noteworthy (bug fixes,
test vectors, important clarifications, etc.). Version 1.0.0 is used to label the promotion to
Complete. A Changelog section may be introduced during the Draft phase to record significant changes (using versions 0.x.y).</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Changelog</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>2.0.0</strong> (2025-01-22):
<ul>
<li>Introduce a breaking change in the specification to fix a bug.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>1.1.0</strong> (2025-01-17):
<ul>
<li>Add a backward compatible extension to the BIP.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>1.0.1</strong> (2025-01-15):
<ul>
<li>Clarify an edge case and add corresponding test vectors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>1.0.0</strong> (2025-01-14):
<ul>
<li>Complete planned work on the BIP.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>After a BIP receives a Changelog, the
Preamble must indicate the latest version in the Version header. The Changelog highlights revisions to BIPs to human readers. A single
BIP shall not recommend more than one variant of an idea at the same time. A different or
competing variant of an existing BIP must be published as a separate BIP.</p>
<h3 id="Adoption_of_Proposals">Adoption of Proposals</h3>
<p>The BIPs repository does not track the sentiment on proposals and does not track the adoption of BIPs beyond whether they
are in active use or not. It is not intended for BIPs to list additional implementations beyond the reference
implementation: the BIPs repository is not a signpost where to find implementations.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#OtherImplementations">13</a></sup> After a BIP
is advanced to Complete, it is up to the Bitcoin community to evaluate, adopt, ignore, or reject a BIP. Individual
Bitcoin projects are encouraged to publish a list of BIPs they implement. A good example of this at the time of writing
this BIP can be observed in Bitcoin Core’s <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/bips.md">doc/bips.md</a>
file.</p>
<h3 id="Transferring_BIP_Ownership">Transferring BIP Ownership</h3>
<p>It occasionally becomes necessary to transfer ownership of BIPs to new owners. In general, it would be preferable to
retain the original authors of the transferred BIP, but that is up to the original authors. A good reason to transfer
ownership is because the original authors no longer have the time or interest in updating it or following through with
the BIP process, or are unreachable or unresponsive. A bad reason
to transfer ownership is because someone doesn't agree with the direction of the BIP. The community tries to build
consensus around a BIP, but if that's not possible, rather than fighting over control, the dissenters should supply a
competing BIP.</p>
<p>If someone is interested in assuming ownership of a BIP, they should send an email asking to take over, addressed to the
original authors, the BIP Editors, and the Bitcoin Development Mailing List<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#bip-announcements-to-list">12</a></sup>. If the authors are unreachable or do not respond in a timely
manner (e.g., four weeks), the BIP Editors will make a unilateral decision whether to appoint the applicants as
<a href="https://bips.dev/3/#authors-and-deputies">Authors or Deputies</a> (which may be amended should the original authors make a delayed reappearance).</p>
<h2 id="BIP_Licensing">BIP Licensing</h2>
<p>The Bitcoin project develops a global peer-to-peer digital cash system. Open standards are indispensable for continued
interoperability. Open standards reduce friction, and encourage anybody and everyone to contribute, compete, and
innovate on a level playing field. Only freely licensed contributions are accepted to the BIPs repository.</p>
<h3 id="Specification-1">Specification</h3>
<p>Each new BIP must specify in two ways under which license terms it is made available. First, it must specify an <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://spdx.dev/ids/">SPDX
License Expression</a> in the License field in the preamble. Second, it must include a matching
Copyright section, possibly providing further details on licensing.</p>
<p>For example, a preamble might include the following License header:</p>
<pre><code>License: CC0-1.0 OR MIT
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, the BIP (including all auxiliary files) is made available under the terms of both CC0 1.0 Universal as well as the
MIT License, and anyone may modify and redistribute it provided they comply with the terms of
<em>either</em> license, at their option. In other words, the license list is an &quot;OR choice&quot;, not an &quot;AND also&quot; requirement. See the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://spdx.dev/ids/">SPDX
documentation</a> and the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://spdx.org/licenses/">SPDX License List</a> for further details.</p>
<p>Wherever different from those specified in the License header, an auxiliary file or directory should specify the license terms under which it is made available as is common in
software (e.g., with a <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://spdx.dev/ids/"><code>SPDX-License-Identifier: &lt;SPDX License Expression&gt;</code> comment</a>,
a license header, or a LICENSE/COPYING file). Such exceptions should also be mentioned in the Copyright section. It is recommended to make any test vectors available
under CC0-1.0 or FSFAP in addition to any other licenses to allow anyone to copy test vectors into their
implementations without introducing license hindrances.</p>
<p>A few BIP2-era BIPs (98, 116, 117, 330, 340) have a no longer used &quot;License-Code&quot; header indicating the license terms applicable to auxiliary source code files. For such cases, please refer to BIP2.</p>
<p>It is recommended that source code included in a BIP (whether within the text or in auxiliary files) be licensed under the same license terms as the project it
is proposed to modify, if any. For example, changes intended for Bitcoin Core would ideally be licensed (also) under the MIT
License.</p>
<p>In all cases, details of the licensing terms must be provided in the Copyright section of the BIP.</p>
<h4 id="Acceptable_Licenses">Acceptable Licenses<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#licenses">14</a></sup></h4>
<p>Each new BIP must be made available under at least one acceptable license as listed below. BIPs are not required to be
<em>exclusively</em> licensed under approved terms, and may also be licensed under other licenses <em>in addition to</em> at least one
acceptable license.</p>
<p>In other words, a new BIP must specify an SPDX License Expression that is either &quot;L&quot; or equivalent to &quot;L OR E&quot; for some
acceptable license L from the following list and another SPDX License Expression E.</p>

<h4 id="Not_Acceptable_Licenses">Not Acceptable Licenses</h4>
<p>All licenses not explicitly included in the above lists are not acceptable terms for a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal.

</ul>
<h3 id="BIP_Editor_Responsibilities_and_Workflow">BIP Editor Responsibilities and Workflow</h3>
<p>The BIP Editors subscribe to the Bitcoin Development Mailing List and watch the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips">BIPs
repository</a>.</p>
<p>When either a new BIP idea or an early draft is submitted to the mailing list, BIP Editors and other community members should comment in regard
to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Novelty of the idea</li>
<li>Viability, utility, and relevance of the concept</li>
<li>Readiness of the proposal</li>
<li>On-topic for the Bitcoin community</li>
</ul>
<p>Discussion in pull request comments can often be hard to follow as feedback gets marked as resolved when it is addressed
by authors. Substantive discussion of ideas may be more accessible to a broader audience on the mailing list, where it
is also more likely to be retained by the community memory.</p>
<p>If the BIP needs more work, an editor should ensure that constructive, actionable feedback is provided to the authors
for revision. Once the BIP is ready it should be submitted as a &quot;pull request&quot; to the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips">BIPs
repository</a> where it may get further feedback.</p>
<p>For each new BIP pull request that comes in, an editor checks the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The idea has been previously proposed by one of the authors to the Bitcoin Development Mailing List and discussed there</li>
<li>The described idea is on-topic for the repository</li>
<li>Title accurately describes the content</li>
<li>Proposal is of general interest and/or pertains to more than one Bitcoin project/implementation</li>
<li>Document is properly formatted</li>
<li>Licensing terms are acceptable</li>
<li>Motivation, Rationale, and Backward Compatibility have been addressed</li>
<li>Specification provides sufficient detail for implementation</li>
<li>The defined Layer header must be correctly assigned for the given specification</li>
<li>The BIP is ready: it is comprehensible, technically feasible and sound, and all aspects are addressed as necessary</li>
</ul>
<p>Editors do NOT evaluate whether the proposal is likely to be adopted.</p>
<p>Then, a BIP Editor will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assign a BIP number and BIP type in the pull request</li>
<li>Ensure that the BIP is listed in the <a href="https://bips.dev/3/README.mediawiki">README</a></li>
<li>Merge the pull request when it is ready</li>
</ul>
<p>The BIP Editors are intended to fulfill administrative and editorial responsibilities. The BIP Editors monitor BIP
changes, and update BIP headers as appropriate.</p>
<p>BIP Editors may also, at their option, unilaterally make and merge strictly editorial changes to BIPs, such as
correcting misspellings, mending grammar mistakes, fixing broken links, etc. as long as they do not change the meaning or conflict with the
original intent of the authors. Such a change must be recorded in the Changelog if it’s noteworthy per the criteria
mentioned in the <a href="https://bips.dev/3/#changelog">Changelog</a> section.</p>

<h2 id="Rationale">Rationale</h2>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="assigned"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">18</sup>
<p><strong>Why was the Created header renamed to Assigned?</strong><br />
Both BIP 1 and BIP 2 described the Created header as &quot;date created on&quot; in the preamble template, but followed that
up with &quot;Created header records the date that the BIP was assigned a number&quot; as the description of the field. This
has frequently led to confusion, with authors using the date of opening the pull request, the date they started
writing their proposal, the date of number assignment (as prescribed), or various other dates. Aligning the name of
the header and the text in the preamble template with the descriptions will reduce the confusion.
<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#capitalization">1</a></sup>: <strong>When is Bitcoin capitalized and when is it lowercased?</strong><br />
This document uses capitalized Bitcoin to refer to the system, network and abstract concept, and only uses lowercase
bitcoin to refer to units of the bitcoin currency.
<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#standard-track">17</a></sup>: <strong>Why was the Specification type introduced?</strong><br />
The definitions of Informational and Standards Track BIPs caused some confusion in the past. Due to Informational
BIPs being described as optional, Standards Track BIPs were sometimes misunderstood to be generally recommended.
This has led to a number of BIPs that propose new features affecting interoperability of implementations being
assigned the Informational type. The situation is remedied by introducing a new <em>Specification BIP</em> type that is
inclusive of any BIPs that can be implemented and affect interoperability of Bitcoin applications. Since all BIPs
are individual recommendations by the authors (even if some may eventually achieve endorsement by the majority of
the community), the prior reminder that Informational BIPs are optional is dropped.
<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#comments">15</a></sup>: <strong>Why were comments, Comments-URI, and Comment-Summary removed from the process?</strong><br />
The comments feature saw insignificant adoption. Few BIPs received any comments and barely any more than two with
only a handful of contributors commenting at all. This led to many situations in which one or two comments ended up
dominating the comment summary. While some of those comments may have been representative of broadly held opinions,
it also overstated the importance of individual comments directly in the Preamble of BIPs. As collecting feedback in
this accessible fashion failed, the new process puts the onus back on the audience to make their own evaluation.
<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#layer">19</a></sup>: <strong>Why is the layer header now permitted for other BIP types?</strong><br />
The layer header had already been used by many Informational BIPs, so the rule that it is only available to
Standards Track BIPs is dropped.
<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#OtherImplementations">13</a></sup>: <strong>What is the issue with &quot;Other Implementations&quot; sections in BIPs?</strong><br />
In the past, some BIPs had &quot;Other Implementations&quot; sections that caused frequent change requests to existing BIPs.
This put an onus on the BIP authors, and frequently led to lingering pull requests due to the corresponding BIPs’
authors no longer participating in the process. Many of these alternative implementations eventually became
unmaintained or were low-quality to begin with. Therefore, &quot;Other Implementations&quot; sections are heavily discouraged.
<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#complete">7</a></sup>: <strong>Why was the Proposed status renamed to Complete?</strong><br />
Some reviewers of this BIP raised that in a process which outlines the workflow of Bitcoin Improvement <em>Proposals</em>
using &quot;Proposed&quot; as a status field value was overloading the term: clearly <em>proposals</em> are proposed at all stages of
the process. &quot;Complete&quot; expresses that the authors have concluded planned work on all parts of the proposal and are
ready to recommend their BIP for adoption. The term &quot;ready&quot; was also considered, but considered too subjective.
<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#rejection">16</a></sup>: <strong>Why can proposals remain in Draft or Complete indefinitely?</strong><br />
The automatic 3-year timeout of BIPs has led to some disagreement in the past and seems unnecessary in cases where
the authors remain active in the community and still consider their idea worth pursuing. On the other hand,
Draft proposals that appear stale may be closed after only one year, which should achieve the main goal of
the original rule by limiting the effort and attention spent on proposals that never reach Complete.
<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#closed">11</a></sup>: <strong>Why was the Closed Status introduced?</strong><br />
The Closed Status provides value to the audience by indicating which documents are only of historical significance.
Previously, the process had Deferred, Obsolete, Rejected, Replaced, and Withdrawn, which all meant some flavor of
&quot;work has stopped on this.&quot; The many statuses complicated the process, may have contributed to process fatigue, and
may have resulted in BIPs’ statuses not being maintained well. The author of this BIP feels that all of the
aforementioned can be represented by <em>Closed</em> without significantly impacting the information quality of the
overview table. Where the many Status variants provided minuscule additional information, the simplification is more
valuable and the Changelog section now collects specific details.
<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#acceptance">2</a></sup>: <strong>When is a BIP &quot;accepted&quot;?</strong><br />
Many standards processes such as the PEPs or the IETF have a mechanism for a proposal to be formally accepted by
some council or committee. The BIP Process does not have such a decision body. Bitcoin development and &quot;acceptance&quot;
of BIPs emerges from the participation of stakeholders across the ecosystem, and refers to some vague notion of community
interest and support for a proposal.<br />
BIP 2 had made an attempt to gather community feedback into comment summaries in BIPs directly. Given the low
participation and corresponding low information quality of the summaries that resulted from that feature, this BIP
instead intends to leave the evaluation of BIPs to the reviewers and users.
<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#adoption">3</a></sup>: <strong>Why does the BIPs repository no longer track adoption?</strong><br />
In the past, some BIPs maintained lists of projects that had implemented the BIP. These lists generated
noise for subscribers of the repository, often listed implementations of questionable quality, and quickly
grew outdated, therefore providing little value. The repository no longer tracks which projects have implemented
BIPs. Instead, it is recommended that projects publish a list of the BIPs they implement.
<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#markdown">4</a></sup>: <strong>Which flavor of Markdown is allowed?</strong><br />
The author of this proposal has no opinion on Markdown flavors, but recommends that proposals stick to the basic
Markdown syntax features commonly shared across Markdown dialects.
<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#living-documents">10</a></sup>: <strong>Why are Process BIPs living documents?</strong><br />
In the past years, the existing BIPs process has not always provided a clear approach to all situations. For
example, the content of BIP 2 appears to have been penned especially with fork proposals in mind. It seems clear
that Bitcoin development will evolve in many surprising ways in the future. Instead of mandating the effort of
writing a new process document every time new situations arise, it seems preferable to allow the process to adapt to
the concerns of the future in specific aspects. Therefore, Process BIPs are defined as living documents that remain
open to amendment. If a Process BIP requires large modifications or even a complete overhaul, a new BIP should be
preferred.
<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#new-BIP">8</a></sup>: <strong>Why should the specification of an implemented BIP no longer be changed?</strong><br />
After a Complete or Deployed BIP has been deployed by one or more implementations, breaking changes to the
specification could lead to a situation where multiple &quot;compliant&quot; implementations fail at being interoperable,
because they implemented different versions of the same BIP. Therefore, even changes to the specification of
Complete BIPs should be avoided, but Deployed BIPs should never be subject to breaking changes to their
specification.
<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#bip-announcements-to-list">12</a></sup>: <strong>Why are some BIP status changes announced to the mailing list?</strong><br />
The BIPs repository does not and cannot track who might be interested in or has deployed a BIP. While concerns were
raised that making announcements to the Bitcoin Developer Mailing List would introduce unnecessary noise, our
rationale is that 1) moving Complete and Deployed BIPs to the Closed status will be a rare occurrence, 2) status
updates will usually not generate a lot of discussion, 3) while the mailing list should preferably only used for
getting review for new BIPs, it is the only channel available to us that can be considered a public announcement to
the audience of the BIPs repository: even if the authors, implementers, or other parties interested in a BIP do not
see the announcement themselves, they may be made aware by someone that does see it.
<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#superseded-by-proposed-replacement">6</a></sup>: <strong>Why is Superseded-By replaced with Proposed-Replacement?</strong><br />
Reviewers asked who should get to decide whether a BIP is superseded in case of a disagreement among the authors of
the original BIP, the authors of the new BIP, the editors, or the community? This is addressed by making the
&quot;Replaces&quot; header part of the recommendation of the authors of the new document, and replacing the &quot;Superseded-By&quot;
header with the &quot;Proposed-Replacement&quot; header that lists any proposals that recommend replacing the original document.
<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#proposes-to-replace">5</a></sup>: <strong>Why was &quot;Replaces&quot; retained instead of changing it to &quot;Proposes-to-Replace&quot;?</strong><br />
When one BIP proposes to supersede another, it is on the original BIP where things get complicated. The BIP is an
author document, but depending on its progress through the workflow, it may meanwhile be co-owned by the community. Who may decide
whether the original document should endorse a potential replacement BIP? Is it the original authors, the authors of the new
proposal, the BIP Editors, some sort of community process, or a mix of all of the above?<br />
On the new BIP these problems don’t exist in the same manner. As it is freshly written, it is wholly owned by its
authors. The community is not yet invested and the original BIP’s authors do not have a privileged role
in determining the content of the new BIP. The authors of the new BIP can unilaterally recommend that it be
considered a replacement for a prior BIP. From there, the community can evaluate the proposal and adopt or
reject it, thus establishing whether it is successful in superseding the original or not.
<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#evidence">9</a></sup>: <strong>How is evidence for advancing to Deployed evaluated?</strong><br />
Whether evidence is deemed convincing to move a BIP to Deployed is up to the BIP Editors and Bitcoin community.
Running a single instance of a personal fork of a software project might be rejected, while a small software project with
dozens of users may be sufficient. The main point of the Deployed status is to indicate that changes to the BIP
could negatively impact users of projects that have already implemented support.
<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#licenses">14</a></sup>: <strong>Why were some licenses dropped?</strong><br />
Among the 141 BIPs with licenses in the repository, only nine licenses have ever been used to license BIPs
(although, some BIPs were made available under more than one license) and only one license has been used to license
code:</p>
</div>
<pre><code>Licenses used:

* BSD-2-Clause: 55
* PD: 42
* CC0-1.0: 23
* BSD-3-Clause: 19
* OPUBL-1.0: 5
* CC-BY-SA-4.0: 4
* FSFAP: 3
* MIT: 2
* CC-BY-4.0: 1

License-Code used (previous BIP2 format):

* BSD-2-Clause: 1
* CC0-1.0: 1
* MIT: 5

The following previously acceptable licenses were retained per request of reviewers, even though they have so far
never been used in the BIPs process:

* Apache-2.0: [Apache License 2.0](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apache.org&#x2F;licenses&#x2F;LICENSE-2.0)
* BSL-1.0: [Boost Software License 1.0](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.boost.org&#x2F;LICENSE_1_0.txt)

The following previously acceptable licenses have never been used in the BIPs Process and have been dropped:

* AGPL-3.0+: [GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL) 3](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;licenses&#x2F;agpl-3.0.en.html)
* FDL-1.3: [GNU Free Documentation License 1.3](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;licenses&#x2F;fdl-1.3.en.html)
* GPL-2.0+: [GNU General Public License (GPL) 2 or newer](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;licenses&#x2F;old-licenses&#x2F;gpl-2.0.en.html)
* LGPL-2.1+: [GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) 2.1 or newer](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;licenses&#x2F;old-licenses&#x2F;lgpl-2.1.en.html)

Why are software licenses included?

* Some BIPs, in particular those concerning the consensus layer, may include literal code in the BIP itself which
  may not be available under the license terms the authors wish to use for the BIP.
* The author of this BIP has been provided with a learned opinion indicating that software licenses are perfectly
  acceptable for licensing &quot;human code&quot; i.e., text as well as Markdown or MediaWiki code.

Why is CC-BY-SA-4.0 no longer acceptable for new BIPs?

* Specification BIPs are required to have a Reference Implementation and Test Vectors to be advanced to Complete. As
  the BIPs repository is aiming to make proposals easily adoptable, the intention is for the reference
  implementation and test vectors to be as accessible as possible. Copyleft licenses may introduce friction here,
  and therefore CC-BY-SA-4.0 (and the GPL-flavors) is no longer considered acceptable for new BIPs. As mentioned
  above, existing BIPs will retain their original licensing.

Why are Open Publication License and Public Domain no longer acceptable for new BIPs?

* Public domain is not universally recognised as a legitimate action, thus it is inadvisable.
* The Open Publication License is generally regarded as obsolete, and not a license suitable for new publications.
