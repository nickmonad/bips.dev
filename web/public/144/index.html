<p>This BIP defines new messages and serialization formats for propagation
of transactions and blocks committing to segregated witness structures.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>In addition to defining witness structures and requiring commitments in
future blocks
(<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki">BIP141</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Consensus segwit BIP), new mechanisms must be defined to allow peers
to advertise support for segregated witness and to relay the witness
structures and request them from other peers without breaking
compatibility with older nodes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>
<h3 id="serialization">Serialization</h3>
<p>A new serialization format for tx messages is added to the peer-to-peer
protocol.</p>
<p>The serialization has the following structure:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Field Size</th><th>Name</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>4</td><td>version</td><td>int32_t</td><td>Transaction data format version</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>marker</td><td>char</td><td>Must be zero</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>flag</td><td>char</td><td>Must be nonzero</td></tr>
<tr><td>1+</td><td>txin_count</td><td>var_int</td><td>Number of transaction inputs</td></tr>
<tr><td>41+</td><td>txins</td><td>txin[]</td><td>A list of one or more transaction inputs</td></tr>
<tr><td>1+</td><td>txout_count</td><td>var_int</td><td>Number of transaction outputs</td></tr>
<tr><td>9+</td><td>txouts</td><td>txouts[]</td><td>A list of one or more transaction outputs</td></tr>
<tr><td>1+</td><td>script_witnesses</td><td>script_witnesses[]</td><td>The witness structure as a serialized byte array</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>lock_time</td><td>uint32_t</td><td>The block number or timestamp until which the transaction is locked</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Parsers supporting this BIP will be able to distinguish between the old
serialization format (without the witness) and this one. The marker byte
is set to zero so that this structure will never parse as a valid
transaction in a parser that does not support this BIP. If parsing were
to succeed, such a transaction would contain no inputs and a single
output.</p>
<p>If the witness is empty, the old serialization format must be used.</p>
<p>Currently, the only witness objects type supported are script witnesses
which consist of a stack of byte arrays. It is encoded as a var_int
item count followed by each item encoded as a var_int length followed
by a string of bytes. Each txin has its own script witness. The number
of script witnesses is not explicitly encoded as it is implied by
txin_count. Empty script witnesses are encoded as a zero byte. The
order of the script witnesses follows the same order as the associated
txins.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rationale for not having an independent message type with its own
serialization</strong>: this would require separate &quot;tx&quot; and &quot;block&quot;
messages, and all RPC calls operating on raw transactions would need
to be duplicated, or need inefficient or nondeterministic guesswork
to know which type is to be used.</li>
</ul>
<!-- end list -->
<ul>
<li><strong>Rationale for not using just a single 0x00 byte as marker</strong>: that
would lead to empty transactions (no inputs, no outputs, which are
used in some tests) to be interpreted as new serialized data.</li>
</ul>
<!-- end list -->
<ul>
<li><strong>Rationale for the 0x01 flag byte in between</strong>: this will allow us
to easily add more extra non-committed data to transactions (like
txouts being spent, ...). It can be interpreted as a bitvector.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="handshake">Handshake</h3>
<p>A node will signal that it can provide witnesses using the following
service bit</p>
<p><code>   NODE_WITNESS = (1 &lt;&lt; 3)</code><br />
<code>   </code></p>
<h3 id="hashes">Hashes</h3>
<p>Transaction hashes used in the transaction merkle tree and txin
outpoints are always computed using the old non-witness serialization.</p>
<p>Support for a new hash including the witness data is added that is
computed from the new witness serialization. (Note that transactions
with an empty witness always use the old serialization, and therefore,
they have witness hash equal to normal hash.)</p>
<p><img src=bip-0144/witnesstx.png></img></p>
<h3 id="relay">Relay</h3>
<p>New inv types MSG_WITNESS_TX (0x40000001, or (1&lt;&lt;30)+MSG_TX) and
MSG_WITNESS_BLOCK (0x40000002, or (1&lt;&lt;30)+MSG_BLOCK) are added,
only for use in getdata. Inventory messages themselves still use just
MSG_TX and MSG_BLOCK, similar to MSG_FILTERED_BLOCK. A further inv
type MSG_FILTERED_WITNESS_BLOCK (0x40000003, or
(1&lt;&lt;30)+MSG_FILTERED_BLOCK) is reserved for future use.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rationale for not advertizing witnessness in invs</strong>: we don't
always use invs anymore (with 'sendheaders' BIP 130), plus it's not
useful: implicitly, every transaction and block have a witness, old
ones just have empty ones.</li>
</ul>
<p>MSG_WITNESS_TX getdata requests should use the non-witness serialized
hash. The peer shall respond with a tx message, and if the witness
structure is nonempty, the witness serialization shall be used.</p>
<p>MSG_WITNESS_BLOCK requests will return a block message with
transactions that have a witness using witness serialization.</p>
