  Title: OP_EVAL

</span></code></pre><h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This BIP describes a new opcode (OP_EVAL) for the <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script">Bitcoin scripting
system</a>, and a new 'standard'
transaction type that uses it to enables the receiver of bitcoins to
specify the transaction type needed to re-spend them.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Enable &quot;end-to-end&quot; secure wallets and payments to fund escrow
transactions or other complex transactions in a way that is
backwards-compatible for old clients and miners.</p>
<h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>
<p>OP_EVAL will re-define the existing OP_NOP1 opcode, and will function
as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>When executed during transaction verification, pops the item from
the top of the stack, deserializes it, and executes the resulting
script.</li>
<li>If there is no item on the top of the stack or the item is not a
valid script then transaction validation fails.</li>
<li>If there are any OP_CODESEPARATORs in the deserialized script then
transaction validation fails.</li>
<li>If there are any OP_EVALs in the deserialized script they are also
executed, but recursion is limited to a depth of 2.</li>
<li>Transaction verification must fail if interpreting OP_EVAL as a
no-op would cause the verification to fail.</li>
</ul>
<p>A new standard transaction type (scriptPubKey) that is relayed by
clients and included in mined blocks is also defined:</p>
<p><code>   DUP HASH160 {20-byte-hash-value} EQUALVERIFY OP_EVAL</code></p>
<p>Which is redeemed by a standard scriptSig:</p>
<p><code>   ...signatures... {serialized script}</code></p>
<p>Transactions that redeem standard OP_EVAL scriptPubKeys are only
considered standard if the <em>serialized script</em> is, itself, one of the
standard transaction types.</p>
<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>OP_EVAL allows the receiver of bitcoins to specify how they can be
spent when they are spent, instead of requiring the sender of the
bitcoins to know the details of how the bitcoins may be redeemed. The
sender only needs to know the hash of the <em>serialized script</em>, and one
new type of bitcoin address can be used to fund arbitrarily complex
transactions.</p>
<p>If <em>serialized script</em> is a large or complicated multi-signature script,
then the burden of paying for it (in increased transaction fees due to
more signature operations or transaction size) is shifted from the
sender to the receiver.</p>
<p>The main objection to OP_EVAL is that it adds complexity, and
complexity is the enemy of security. Also, evaluating data as code has a
long record of being a source of security vulnerabilties.</p>
<p>That same argument can be applied to the existing Bitcoin 'scripting'
system; scriptPubKeys are transmit as data across the network and are
then interpreted by every bitcoin implementation. OP_EVAL just moves
the data that will be interpreted. It is debatable whether or not the
entire idea of putting a little interpreted expression evaluation
language at the core of Bitcoin was brilliant or stupid, but the
existence of OP_EVAL does not make the expression language less secure.</p>
<p>There is a 1-confirmation attack on old clients that interepret OP_EVAL
as a no-op, but it is expensive and difficult in practice. The attack
is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Attacker creates an OP_EVAL transaction that is valid as seen by
old clients, but invalid for new clients.</li>
<li>Attacker also creates a standard transaction that spends the
OP_EVAL transaction, and pays the victim.</li>
<li>Attacker manages to mine a block that contains both transactions. If
the victim accepts the 1-confirmation payment, then the attacker
wins because both transactions will be invalidated when the rest of
the network overwrites the attacker's invalid block.</li>
</ol>
<p>The attack is expensive because it requires the attacker create a block
that they know will be invalidated. It is difficult because bitcoin
businesses should not accept 1-confirmation transactions for
higher-value transactions.</p>
<h2 id="backwards-compatibility">Backwards Compatibility</h2>
<p>Surprisingly, because OP_EVAL redefines the OP_NOP1 opcode, standard
OP_EVAL transactions will validate with old clients and miners. They
will check only that the <em>serialized script</em> hashes to the correct
value; the OP_EVAL will be interpreted as a no-op, and as long as the
hash is correct the transaction will be considered valid (no signature
checking will be done by old clients and miners).</p>
<p>Old clients will ignore OP_EVAL transactions and transactions that
depend on them until they are put into a block by either an old miner
that includes non-standard transactions in its blocks or by a new miner.</p>
<p>Avoiding a block-chain split by malicious OP_EVAL transactions requires
careful handling of two cases:</p>
<ol>
<li>An OP_EVAL transaction that is invalid for new clients/miners but
valid for old clients/miners.</li>
<li>An OP_EVAL transaction that is valid for new clients/miners but
invalid for old clients/miners.</li>
</ol>
<p>For case (1), new clients and miners will be coded to interpret OP_EVAL
as a no-op until February 1, 2012. Before then, miners will be asked to
put the string &quot;OP_EVAL&quot; in blocks that they produce so that hashing
power that supports the new opcode can be gauged. If less than 50% of
miners accept the change as of January 15, 2012 the rollout will be
postponed until more than 50% of hashing power supports OP_EVAL (the
rollout will be rejected if it becomes clear that a majority of hashing
power will not be achieved).</p>
<p>For case (2), new clients and miners will be written to make sure that
transactions involving OP_EVAL are valid if OP_EVAL is interpreted as
a no-op. Example of a transaction that must fail for both old and new
miners/clients:</p>
<p><code> scriptSig:  {serialized OP_11}</code><br />
<code> scriptPubKey:  OP_EVAL OP_11 OP_EQUAL</code></p>
