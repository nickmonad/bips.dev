</span></code></pre><h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This BIP defines a new structure called a &quot;witness&quot; that is committed to
blocks separately from the transaction merkle tree. This structure
contains data required to check transaction validity but not required to
determine transaction effects. In particular, scripts and signatures are
moved into this new structure.</p>
<p>The witness is committed in a tree that is nested into the block's
existing merkle root via the coinbase transaction for the purpose of
making this BIP soft fork compatible. A future hard fork can place this
tree in its own branch.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>The entirety of the transaction's effects are determined by output
consumption (spends) and new output creation. Other transaction data,
and signatures in particular, are only required to validate the
blockchain state, not to determine it.</p>
<p>By removing this data from the transaction structure committed to the
transaction merkle tree, several problems are fixed:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Nonintentional malleability becomes impossible</strong>. Since signature
data is no longer part of the transaction hash, changes to how the
transaction was signed are no longer relevant to transaction
identification. As a solution of transaction malleability, this is
superior to the canonical signature approach
(<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0062.mediawiki">BIP62</a>):
<ul>
<li>It prevents involuntary transaction malleability for any type of
scripts, as long as all inputs are signed (with at least one
CHECKSIG or CHECKMULTISIG operation)</li>
<li>In the case of an m-of-n CHECKMULTISIG script, a transaction is
malleable only with agreement of m private key holders (as
opposed to only 1 private key holder with BIP62)</li>
<li>It prevents involuntary transaction malleability due to unknown
ECDSA signature malleability</li>
<li>It allows creation of unconfirmed transaction dependency chains
without counterparty risk, an important feature for offchain
protocols such as the Lightning Network</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Transmission of signature data becomes optional</strong>. It is needed
only if a peer is trying to validate a transaction instead of just
checking its existence. This reduces the size of SPV proofs and
potentially improves the privacy of SPV clients as they can download
more transactions using the same bandwidth.</li>
<li><strong>Some constraints could be bypassed with a soft fork</strong> by moving
part of the transaction data to a structure unknown to current
protocol, for example:
<ul>
<li>Size of witness could be ignored / discounted when calculating
the block size, effectively increasing the block size to some
extent</li>
<li>Hard coded constants, such as maximum data push size (520 bytes)
or sigops limit could be reevaluated or removed</li>
<li>New script system could be introduced without any limitation
from the existing script semantic. For example, a new
transaction digest algorithm for transaction signature
verification is described in
<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0143.mediawiki">BIP143</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>
<h3 id="transaction-id">Transaction ID</h3>
<p>A new data structure, <code>witness</code>, is defined. Each transaction will have
2 IDs.</p>
<p>Definition of <code>txid</code> remains unchanged: the double SHA256 of the
traditional serialization format:</p>
<p><code> [nVersion][txins][txouts][nLockTime]</code><br />
<code> </code></p>
<p>A new <code>wtxid</code> is defined: the double SHA256 of the new serialization
with witness data:</p>
<p><code> [nVersion][marker][flag][txins][txouts][witness][nLockTime]</code><br />
<code> </code></p>
<p>Format of <code>nVersion</code>, <code>txins</code>, <code>txouts</code>, and <code>nLockTime</code> are same as
traditional serialization.</p>
<p>The <code>marker</code> MUST be a 1-byte zero value: <code>0x00</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>flag</code> MUST be a 1-byte non-zero value. Currently, <code>0x01</code> MUST be
used.</p>
<p>The <code>witness</code> is a serialization of all witness data of the transaction.
Each txin is associated with a witness field. A witness field starts
with a <code>var_int</code> to indicate the number of stack items for the txin. It
is followed by stack items, with each item starts with a <code>var_int</code> to
indicate the length. Witness data is NOT script.</p>
<p>A non-witness program (defined hereinafter) txin MUST be associated with
an empty witness field, represented by a <code>0x00</code>. If all txins are not
witness program, a transaction's <code>wtxid</code> is equal to its <code>txid</code>.</p>
<h3 id="commitment-structure">Commitment structure</h3>
<p>A new block rule is added which requires a commitment to the <code>wtxid</code>.
The <code>wtxid</code> of coinbase transaction is assumed to be <code>0x0000....0000</code>.</p>
<p>A <code>witness root hash</code> is calculated with all those <code>wtxid</code> as leaves, in
a way similar to the <code>hashMerkleRoot</code> in the block header.</p>
<p>The commitment is recorded in a <code>scriptPubKey</code> of the coinbase
transaction. It must be at least 38 bytes, with the first 6-byte of
<code>0x6a24aa21a9ed</code>, that is:</p>
<p><code>  1-byte - OP_RETURN (0x6a)</code><br />
<code>  1-byte - Push the following 36 bytes (0x24)</code><br />
<code>  4-byte - Commitment header (0xaa21a9ed)</code><br />
<code> 32-byte - Commitment hash: Double-SHA256(witness root hash|witness reserved value)</code><br />
<code> </code><br />
<code> 39th byte onwards: Optional data with no consensus meaning</code><br />
<code> </code></p>
<p>and the coinbase's input's witness must consist of a single 32-byte
array for the <code>witness reserved value</code>.</p>
<p>If there are more than one <code>scriptPubKey</code> matching the pattern, the one
with highest output index is assumed to be the commitment.</p>
<p>If all transactions in a block do not have witness data, the commitment
is optional.</p>
<h3 id="witness-program">Witness program</h3>
<p>A <code>scriptPubKey</code> (or <code>redeemScript</code> as defined in BIP16/P2SH) that
consists of a 1-byte push opcode (for 0 to 16) followed by a data push
between 2 and 40 bytes gets a new special meaning. The value of the
first push is called the &quot;version byte&quot;. The following byte vector
pushed is called the &quot;witness program&quot;.</p>
<p>There are two cases in which witness validation logic are triggered.
Each case determines the location of the witness version byte and
program, as well as the form of the scriptSig:</p>
<ol>
<li>Triggered by a <code>scriptPubKey</code> that is exactly a push of a version
byte, plus a push of a witness program. The scriptSig must be
exactly empty or validation fails. (<em>&quot;native witness program&quot;</em>)</li>
<li>Triggered when a <code>scriptPubKey</code> is a P2SH script, and the BIP16
<code>redeemScript</code> pushed in the <code>scriptSig</code> is exactly a push of a
version byte plus a push of a witness program. The <code>scriptSig</code> must
be exactly a push of the BIP16 <code>redeemScript</code> or validation fails.
(<em>&quot;P2SH witness program&quot;</em>)</li>
</ol>
<p>If the version byte is 0, and the witness program is 20 bytes:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is interpreted as a pay-to-witness-public-key-hash (P2WPKH)
program.</li>
<li>The witness must consist of exactly 2 items (≤ 520 bytes each). The
first one a signature, and the second one a public key.</li>
<li>The HASH160 of the public key must match the 20-byte witness
program.</li>
<li>After normal script evaluation, the signature is verified against
the public key with CHECKSIG operation. The verification must result
in a single TRUE on the stack.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the version byte is 0, and the witness program is 32 bytes:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is interpreted as a pay-to-witness-script-hash (P2WSH) program.</li>
<li>The witness must consist of an input stack to feed to the script,
followed by a serialized script (<code>witnessScript</code>).</li>
<li>The <code>witnessScript</code> (≤ 10,000 bytes) is popped off the initial
witness stack. SHA256 of the <code>witnessScript</code> must match the 32-byte
witness program.</li>
<li>The <code>witnessScript</code> is deserialized, and executed after normal
script evaluation with the remaining witness stack (≤ 520 bytes for
each stack item).</li>
<li>The script must not fail, and result in exactly a single TRUE on the
stack.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the version byte is 0, but the witness program is neither 20 nor 32
bytes, the script must fail.[1]</p>
<p>If the version byte is 1 to 16, no further interpretation of the witness
program or witness stack happens, and there is no size restriction for
the witness stack. These versions are reserved for future
extensions.[2]</p>
<h3 id="other-consensus-critical-limits">Other consensus critical limits</h3>
<h4 id="block-size">Block size</h4>
<p>Blocks are currently limited to 1,000,000 bytes (1MB) total size. We
change this restriction as follows:</p>
<p><em>Block weight</em> is defined as <em>Base size</em> * 3 + <em>Total size</em>.
(rationale[3])</p>
<p><em>Base size</em> is the block size in bytes with the original transaction
serialization without any witness-related data, as seen by a
non-upgraded node.</p>
<p><em>Total size</em> is the block size in bytes with transactions serialized as
described in <a href="https://bips.dev/141/bip-0144.mediawiki" title="wikilink">BIP144</a>, including base
data and witness data.</p>
<p>The new rule is <em>block weight</em> ≤ 4,000,000.</p>
<h4 id="sigops">Sigops</h4>
<p>Sigops per block is currently limited to 20,000. We change this
restriction as follows:</p>
<p>Sigops in the current pubkey script, signature script, and P2SH check
script are counted at 4 times their previous value. The sigop limit is
likewise quadrupled to ≤ 80,000.</p>
<p>Each P2WPKH input is counted as 1 sigop. In addition, opcodes within a
P2WSH <code>witnessScript</code> are counted identically as previously within the
P2SH <code>redeemScript</code>. That is, CHECKSIG is counted as only 1 sigop. When
preceded by OP_1 to OP_16 CHECKMULTISIG is counted as 1 to 16 sigops
respectively, otherwise it is counted as 20 sigops. This rule applies to
both native witness program and P2SH witness program.</p>
<h3 id="additional-definitions">Additional definitions</h3>
<p>The following definitions are not used for consensus limits, but are
suggested to provide language consistent with the terminology introduced
above.</p>
<h4 id="transaction-size-calculations">Transaction size calculations</h4>
<p><em>Transaction weight</em> is defined as <em>Base transaction size</em> * 3 + <em>Total
transaction size</em> (ie. the same method as calculating <em>Block weight</em>
from <em>Base size</em> and <em>Total size</em>).</p>
<p><em>Virtual transaction size</em> is defined as <em>Transaction weight</em> / 4
(rounded up to the next integer).</p>
<p><em>Base transaction size</em> is the size of the transaction serialised with
the witness data stripped.</p>
<p><em>Total transaction size</em> is the transaction size in bytes serialized as
described in <a href="https://bips.dev/141/bip-0144.mediawiki" title="wikilink">BIP144</a>, including base
data and witness data.</p>
<h3 id="new-script-semantics">New script semantics</h3>
<p>Despite that the script language for P2WPKH and P2WSH looks very similar
to pre-segregated witness script, there are several notable differences.
Users MUST NOT assume that a script spendable in pre-segregated witness
system would also be spendable as a P2WPKH or P2WSH script. Before
large-scale deployment in the production network, developers should test
the scripts on testnet with the default relay policy turned on, and with
a small amount of money after BIP141 is activated on mainnet.</p>
<p>A major difference at consensus level is described in
<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0143.mediawiki">BIP143</a>,
as a new transaction digest algorithm for signature verification in
version 0 witness program.</p>
<p>Three relay and mining policies are also included in the first release
of segregated witness at reference implementation version 0.13.1.
Softforks based on these policies are likely to be proposed in the near
future. To avoid indefinite delay in transaction confirmation and
permanent fund loss in a potential softfork, users MUST observe the new
semantics carefully:</p>
<ol>
<li>Only compressed public keys are accepted in P2WPKH and P2WSH (See
<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0143.mediawiki#Restrictions_on_public_key_type">BIP143</a>)</li>
<li>The argument of OP_IF/NOTIF in P2WSH must be minimal[4]</li>
<li>Signature(s) must be null vector(s) if an OP_CHECKSIG or
OP_CHECKMULTISIG is failed (for both pre-segregated witness script
and P2WSH. See
<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0146.mediawiki">BIP146</a>)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<h3 id="p2wpkh">P2WPKH</h3>
<p>The following example is a version 0 pay-to-witness-public-key-hash
(P2WPKH):</p>
<p><code>   witness:      </code><signature><code> </code><pubkey><br />
<code>   scriptSig:    (empty)</code><br />
<code>   scriptPubKey: 0 &lt;20-byte-key-hash&gt;</code><br />
<code>                 (0x0014{20-byte-key-hash})</code></p>
<p>The '0' in scriptPubKey indicates the following push is a version 0
witness program. The length of the witness program indicates that it is
a P2WPKH type. The witness must consist of exactly 2 items. The HASH160
of the pubkey in witness must match the witness program.</p>
<p>The signature is verified as</p>
<p><code>   </code><signature><code> </code><pubkey><code> CHECKSIG</code></p>
<p>Comparing with a traditional P2PKH output, the P2WPKH equivalent
occupies 3 less bytes in the scriptPubKey, and moves the signature and
public key from scriptSig to witness.</p>
<h3 id="p2wpkh-nested-in-bip16-p2sh">P2WPKH nested in BIP16 P2SH</h3>
<p>The following example is the same P2WPKH, but nested in a BIP16 P2SH
output.</p>
<p><code>   witness:      </code><signature><code> </code><pubkey><br />
<code>   scriptSig:    &lt;0 &lt;20-byte-key-hash&gt;&gt;</code><br />
<code>                 (0x160014{20-byte-key-hash})</code><br />
<code>   scriptPubKey: HASH160 &lt;20-byte-script-hash&gt; EQUAL</code><br />
<code>                 (0xA914{20-byte-script-hash}87)</code></p>
<p>The only item in scriptSig is hashed with HASH160, compared against the
20-byte-script-hash in scriptPubKey, and interpreted as:</p>
<p><code>   0 &lt;20-byte-key-hash&gt;</code></p>
<p>The public key and signature are then verified as described in the
previous example.</p>
<p>Comparing with the previous example, the scriptPubKey is 1 byte bigger
and the scriptSig is 23 bytes bigger. Although a nested witness program
is less efficient, its payment address is fully transparent and backward
compatible for all Bitcoin reference client since version 0.6.0.</p>
<h3 id="p2wsh">P2WSH</h3>
<p>The following example is an 1-of-2 multi-signature version 0
pay-to-witness-script-hash (P2WSH).</p>
<p><code>   witness:      0 </code><signature1><code> &lt;1 </code><pubkey1><code> </code><pubkey2><code> 2 CHECKMULTISIG&gt;</code><br />
<code>   scriptSig:    (empty)</code><br />
<code>   scriptPubKey: 0 &lt;32-byte-hash&gt;</code><br />
<code>                 (0x0020{32-byte-hash})</code></p>
<p>The '0' in scriptPubKey indicates the following push is a version 0
witness program. The length of the witness program indicates that it is
a P2WSH type. The last item in the witness (the &quot;witnessScript&quot;) is
popped off, hashed with SHA256, compared against the 32-byte-hash in
scriptPubKey, and deserialized:</p>
<p><code>   1 </code><pubkey1><code> </code><pubkey2><code> 2 CHECKMULTISIG</code></p>
<p>The script is executed with the remaining data from witness:</p>
<p><code>   0 </code><signature1><code> 1 </code><pubkey1><code> </code><pubkey2><code> 2 CHECKMULTISIG</code></p>
<p>P2WSH allows maximum script size of 10,000 bytes, as the 520-byte push
limit is bypassed.</p>
<p>The scriptPubKey occupies 34 bytes, as opposed to 23 bytes of BIP16
P2SH. The increased size improves security against possible collision
attacks, as 2<sup>80</sup> work is not infeasible anymore (By the end of
2015, 2<sup>84</sup> hashes have been calculated in Bitcoin mining since
the creation of Bitcoin). The spending script is same as the one for an
equivalent BIP16 P2SH output but is moved to witness.</p>
<h3 id="p2wsh-nested-in-bip16-p2sh">P2WSH nested in BIP16 P2SH</h3>
<p>The following example is the same 1-of-2 multi-signature P2WSH script,
but nested in a BIP16 P2SH output.</p>
<p><code>   witness:      0 </code><signature1><code> &lt;1 </code><pubkey1><code> </code><pubkey2><code> 2 CHECKMULTISIG&gt;</code><br />
<code>   scriptSig:    &lt;0 &lt;32-byte-hash&gt;&gt;</code><br />
<code>                 (0x220020{32-byte-hash})</code><br />
<code>   scriptPubKey: HASH160 &lt;20-byte-hash&gt; EQUAL</code><br />
<code>                 (0xA914{20-byte-hash}87)</code></p>
<p>The only item in scriptSig is hashed with HASH160, compared against the
20-byte-hash in scriptPubKey, and interpreted as:</p>
<p><code>   0 &lt;32-byte-hash&gt;</code></p>
<p>The P2WSH witnessScript is then executed as described in the previous
example.</p>
<p>Comparing with the previous example, the scriptPubKey is 11 bytes
smaller (with reduced security) while witness is the same. However, it
also requires 35 bytes in scriptSig.</p>
<h3 id="extensible-commitment-structure">Extensible commitment structure</h3>
<p>The new commitment in coinbase transaction is a hash of the <code>witness root hash</code> and a <code>witness reserved value</code>. The <code>witness reserved value</code>
currently has no consensus meaning, but in the future allows new
commitment values for future softforks. For example, if a new
consensus-critical commitment is required in the future, the commitment
in coinbase becomes:</p>
<p><code> Double-SHA256(Witness root hash|Hash(new commitment|witness reserved value))</code></p>
<p>For backward compatibility, the <code>Hash(new commitment|witness reserved value)</code> will go to the coinbase witness, and the <code>witness reserved value</code> will be recorded in another location specified by the future
softfork. Any number of new commitment could be added in this way.</p>
<p>Any commitments that are not consensus-critical to Bitcoin, such as
merge-mining, MUST NOT use the <code>witness reserved value</code> to preserve the
ability to do upgrades of the Bitcoin consensus protocol.</p>
<p>The optional data space following the commitment also leaves room for
metadata of future softforks, and MUST NOT be used for other purpose.</p>
<h3 id="trust-free-unconfirmed-transaction-dependency-chain">Trust-free unconfirmed transaction dependency chain</h3>
<p>Segregated witness fixes the problem of transaction malleability
fundamentally, which enables the building of unconfirmed transaction
dependency chains in a trust-free manner.</p>
<p>Two parties, Alice and Bob, may agree to send certain amount of Bitcoin
to a 2-of-2 multisig output (the &quot;funding transaction&quot;). Without signing
the funding transaction, they may create another transaction,
time-locked in the future, spending the 2-of-2 multisig output to third
account(s) (the &quot;spending transaction&quot;). Alice and Bob will sign the
spending transaction and exchange the signatures. After examining the
signatures, they will sign and commit the funding transaction to the
blockchain. Without further action, the spending transaction will be
confirmed after the lock-time and release the funding according to the
original contract. It also retains the flexibility of revoking the
original contract before the lock-time, by another spending transaction
with shorter lock-time, but only with mutual-agreement of both parties.</p>
<p>Such setups are not possible with BIP62 as the malleability fix, since
the spending transaction could not be created without both parties first
signing the funding transaction. If Alice reveals the funding
transaction signature before Bob does, Bob is able to lock up the
funding indefinitely without ever signing the spending transaction.</p>
<p>Unconfirmed transaction dependency chain is a fundamental building block
of more sophisticated payment networks, such as duplex micropayment
channel and the Lightning Network, which have the potential to greatly
improve the scalability and efficiency of the Bitcoin system.</p>
<h2 id="future-extensions">Future extensions</h2>
<h3 id="compact-fraud-proof-for-spv-nodes">Compact fraud proof for SPV nodes</h3>
<p>Bitcoin right now only has two real security models. A user either runs
a full-node which validates every block with all rules in the system, or
a SPV (Simple Payment Verification) client which only validates the
headers as a proof of publication of some transactions. The Bitcoin
whitepaper suggested that SPV nodes may accept alerts from full nodes
when they detect an invalid block, prompting the SPV node to download
the questioned blocks and transactions for validation. This approach,
however, could become a DoS attack vector as there is virtually no cost
to generate a false alarm. An alarm must come with a compact, yet
deterministic fraud proof.</p>
<p>In the current Bitcoin protocol, it is possible to generate compact
fraud proof for almost all rules except a few:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is not possible to prove a miner has introduced too many Bitcoins
in the coinbase transaction outputs without showing the whole block
itself and all input transactions.</li>
<li>It is not possible to prove the violation of any block specific
constraints, such as size and sigop limits, without showing the
whole block (and all input transactions in the case of sigop limit)</li>
<li>It is not possible to prove the spending of a non-existing input
without showing all transaction IDs in the blockchain way back to
the genesis block.</li>
</ol>
<p>Extra witness data can be committed that allows short proofs of block
invalidity that SPV nodes can quickly verify:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sum trees for transaction fee can be committed making it possible to
construct short proofs that the miner does not add excessive fees to
the coinbase transaction. Similar for the block size and sigop count
limit.</li>
<li>Backlinks for the outputs spent by the transaction's inputs can be
provided. These backlinks consist of a block hash and an offset that
thin clients can easily query and check to verify that the outputs
exist.</li>
</ol>
<p>These commitments could be included in the extensible commitment
structure through a soft fork and will be transparent to nodes that do
not understand such new rules.</p>
<h3 id="new-script-system">New script system</h3>
<p>Since a version byte is pushed before a witness program, and programs
with unknown versions are always considered as anyone-can-spend script,
it is possible to introduce any new script system with a soft fork. The
witness as a structure is not restricted by any existing script
semantics and constraints, the 520-byte push limit in particular, and
therefore allows arbitrarily large scripts and signatures.</p>
<p>Examples of new script system include Schnorr signatures which reduce
the size of multisig transactions dramatically, Lamport signature which
is quantum computing resistance, and Merklized abstract syntax trees
which allow very compact witness for conditional scripts with extreme
complexity.</p>
<h3 id="per-input-lock-time-and-relative-lock-time">Per-input lock-time and relative-lock-time</h3>
<p>Currently there is only one nLockTime field in a transaction and all
inputs must share the same value.
<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0068.mediawiki">BIP68</a>
enables per-input relative-lock-time using the nSequence field, however,
with a limited lock-time period and resolution.</p>
<p>With a soft fork, it is possible to introduce a separate witness
structure to allow per-input lock-time and relative-lock-time, and a new
script system that could sign and manipulate the new data (like
<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0065.mediawiki">BIP65</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0112.mediawiki">BIP112</a>).</p>
<h2 id="backward-compatibility">Backward compatibility</h2>
<p>As a soft fork, older software will continue to operate without
modification. Non-upgraded nodes, however, will not see nor validate the
witness data and will consider all witness programs as anyone-can-spend
scripts (except a few edge cases where the witness programs are equal to
0, which the script must fail). Wallets should always be wary of
anyone-can-spend scripts and treat them with suspicion. Non-upgraded
nodes are strongly encouraged to upgrade in order to take advantage of
the new features.</p>
<p><strong>What a non-upgraded wallet can do</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Receiving bitcoin from non-upgraded and upgraded wallets</li>
<li>Sending bitcoin to non-upgraded and upgraded wallets with
traditional P2PKH address (without any benefit of segregated
witness)</li>
<li>Sending bitcoin to upgraded wallets using a P2SH address</li>
<li>Sending bitcoin to upgraded wallets using a native witness program
through
<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0070.mediawiki">BIP70</a>
payment protocol</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What a non-upgraded wallet cannot do</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Validating segregated witness transaction. It assumes such a
transaction is always valid</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="deployment">Deployment</h2>
<p>This BIP will be deployed by &quot;version bits&quot; BIP9 with the name &quot;segwit&quot;
and using bit 1.</p>
<p>For Bitcoin mainnet, the BIP9 starttime will be midnight 15 november
2016 UTC (Epoch timestamp 1479168000) and BIP9 timeout will be midnight
15 november 2017 UTC (Epoch timestamp 1510704000).</p>
<p>For Bitcoin testnet, the BIP9 starttime will be midnight 1 May 2016 UTC
(Epoch timestamp 1462060800) and BIP9 timeout will be midnight 1 May
2017 UTC (Epoch timestamp 1493596800).</p>

<li>For example, a scriptPubKey with OP_0 followed by a 40-byte
non-zero data push will fail due to incorrect program size. However,
a scriptPubKey with OP_0 followed by a 41-byte non-zero data push
will pass, since it is not considered to be a witness program</li>
<li>For backward compatibility, for any version byte from 0 to 16, the
script must fail if the witness program has a <code>CastToBool</code> value of
zero. However, having a hash like this is a successful preimage
attack against the hash function, and the risk is negligible.</li>
<li>Rationale of using a single composite constraint, instead of two
separate limits such as 1MB base data and 3MB witness data: Using
two separate limits would make mining and fee estimation nearly
impossible. Miners would need to solve a complex non-linear
optimization problem to find the set of transactions that maximize
fees given both constraints, and wallets would not be able to know
what to pay as it depends on which of the two conditions is most
constrained by the time miners try to produce blocks with their
transactions in. Another problem with such an approach is
freeloading. Once a set of transactions hit the base data 1MB
constraint, up to 3MB extra data could be added to the witness by
just minimally increasing the fee. The marginal cost for extra
witness space effectively becomes zero in that case.</li>
