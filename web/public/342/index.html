<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>This document specifies the semantics of the initial scripting system
under <a href="https://bips.dev/342/bip-0341.mediawiki" title="wikilink">BIP341</a>.</p>

<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
<p><a href="https://bips.dev/342/bip-0341.mediawiki" title="wikilink">BIP341</a> proposes improvements to just
the script structure, but some of its goals are incompatible with the
semantics of certain opcodes within the scripting language itself. While
it is possible to deal with these in separate optional improvements,
their impact is not guaranteed unless they are addressed simultaneously
with <a href="https://bips.dev/342/bip-0341.mediawiki" title="wikilink">BIP341</a> itself.</p>
<p>Specifically, the goal is making <strong>Schnorr signatures</strong>, <strong>batch
validation</strong>, and <strong>signature hash</strong> improvements available to spends
that use the script system as well.</p>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p>In order to achieve these goals, signature opcodes <code>OP_CHECKSIG</code> and
<code>OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY</code> are modified to verify Schnorr signatures as
specified in <a href="https://bips.dev/342/bip-0340.mediawiki" title="wikilink">BIP340</a> and to use a
signature message algorithm based on the common message calculation in
<a href="https://bips.dev/342/bip-0341.mediawiki" title="wikilink">BIP341</a>. The tapscript signature message
also simplifies <code>OP_CODESEPARATOR</code> handling and makes it more efficient.</p>
<p>The inefficient <code>OP_CHECKMULTISIG</code> and <code>OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY</code> opcodes
are disabled. Instead, a new opcode <code>OP_CHECKSIGADD</code> is introduced to
allow creating the same multisignature policies in a batch-verifiable
way. Tapscript uses a new, simpler signature opcode limit fixing
complicated interactions with transaction weight. Furthermore, a
potential malleability vector is eliminated by requiring MINIMALIF.</p>
<p>Tapscript can be upgraded through soft forks by defining unknown key
types, for example to add new <code>hash_types</code> or signature algorithms.
Additionally, the new tapscript <code>OP_SUCCESS</code> opcodes allow introducing
new opcodes more cleanly than through <code>OP_NOP</code>.</p>
<h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>
<p>The rules below only apply when validating a transaction input for which
all of the conditions below are true:</p>
<ul>
<li>The transaction input is a <strong>segregated witness spend</strong> (i.e., the
scriptPubKey contains a witness program as defined in
<a href="https://bips.dev/342/bip-0141.mediawiki" title="wikilink">BIP141</a>).</li>
<li>It is a <strong>taproot spend</strong> as defined in
<a href="https://bips.dev/342/bip-0341.mediawiki#design" title="wikilink">BIP341</a> (i.e., the witness
version is 1, the witness program is 32 bytes, and it is not P2SH
wrapped).</li>
<li>It is a <strong>script path spend</strong> as defined in
<a href="https://bips.dev/342/bip-0341.mediawiki#design" title="wikilink">BIP341</a> (i.e., after removing
the optional annex from the witness stack, two or more stack
elements remain).</li>
<li>The leaf version is <em>0xc0</em> (i.e. the first byte of the last witness
element after removing the optional annex is <em>0xc0</em> or <em>0xc1</em>),
marking it as a <strong>tapscript spend</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Validation of such inputs must be equivalent to performing the following
steps in the specified order.</p>
<ol>
<li>If the input is invalid due to BIP141 or BIP341, fail.</li>
<li>The script as defined in BIP341 (i.e., the penultimate witness stack
element after removing the optional annex) is called the
<strong>tapscript</strong> and is decoded into opcodes, one by one:
<ol>
<li>If any opcode numbered <em>80, 98, 126-129, 131-134, 137-138,
141-142, 149-153, 187-254</em> is encountered, validation succeeds
(none of the rules below apply). This is true even if later
bytes in the tapscript would fail to decode otherwise. These
opcodes are renamed to <code>OP_SUCCESS80</code>, ..., <code>OP_SUCCESS254</code>, and
collectively known as <code>OP_SUCCESSx</code><ref><strong><code>OP_SUCCESSx</code></strong>
<code>OP_SUCCESSx</code> is a mechanism to upgrade the Script system. Using
an <code>OP_SUCCESSx</code> before its meaning is defined by a softfork is
insecure and leads to fund loss. The inclusion of <code>OP_SUCCESSx</code>
in a script will pass it unconditionally. It precedes any script
execution rules to avoid the difficulties in specifying various
edge cases, for example: <code>OP_SUCCESSx</code> in a script with an input
stack larger than 1000 elements, <code>OP_SUCCESSx</code> after too many
signature opcodes, or even scripts with conditionals lacking
<code>OP_ENDIF</code>. The mere existence of an <code>OP_SUCCESSx</code> anywhere in
the script will guarantee a pass for all such cases.
<code>OP_SUCCESSx</code> are similar to the <code>OP_RETURN</code> in very early
bitcoin versions (v0.1 up to and including v0.3.5). The original
<code>OP_RETURN</code> terminates script execution immediately, and return
pass or fail based on the top stack element at the moment of
termination. This was one of a major design flaws in the
original bitcoin protocol as it permitted unconditional third
party theft by placing an <code>OP_RETURN</code> in <code>scriptSig</code>. This is
not a concern in the present proposal since it is not possible
for a third party to inject an <code>OP_SUCCESSx</code> to the validation
process, as the <code>OP_SUCCESSx</code> is part of the script (and thus
committed to by the taproot output), implying the consent of the
coin owner. <code>OP_SUCCESSx</code> can be used for a variety of upgrade
possibilities:</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<!-- end list -->
<ul>
<li>An <code>OP_SUCCESSx</code> could be turned into a functional opcode through a
softfork. Unlike <code>OP_NOPx</code>-derived opcodes which only have read-only
access to the stack, <code>OP_SUCCESSx</code> may also write to the stack. Any
rule changes to an <code>OP_SUCCESSx</code>-containing script may only turn a
valid script into an invalid one, and this is always achievable with
softforks.</li>
<li>Since <code>OP_SUCCESSx</code> precedes size check of initial stack and push
opcodes, an <code>OP_SUCCESSx</code>-derived opcode requiring stack elements
bigger than 520 bytes may uplift the limit in a softfork.</li>
<li><code>OP_SUCCESSx</code> may also redefine the behavior of existing opcodes so
they could work together with the new opcode. For example, if an
<code>OP_SUCCESSx</code>-derived opcode works with 64-bit integers, it may also
allow the existing arithmetic opcodes in the <em>same script</em> to do the
same.</li>
<li>Given that <code>OP_SUCCESSx</code> even causes potentially unparseable scripts
to pass, it can be used to introduce multi-byte opcodes, or even a
completely new scripting language when prefixed with a specific
<code>OP_SUCCESSx</code> opcode.</ref>.</li>
</ul>
<!-- end list -->
<ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li>If any push opcode fails to decode because it would extend past
the end of the tapscript, fail.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the <strong>initial stack</strong> as defined in BIP341 (i.e., the witness
stack after removing both the optional annex and the two last stack
elements after that) violates any resource limits (stack size, and
size of the elements in the stack; see &quot;Resource Limits&quot; below),
fail. Note that this check can be bypassed using <code>OP_SUCCESSx</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tapscript is executed according to the rules in the following
section, with the initial stack as input.</p>
<ol>
<li>If execution fails for any reason, fail.</li>
<li>If the execution results in anything but exactly one element on
the stack which evaluates to true with <code>CastToBool()</code>, fail.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If this step is reached without encountering a failure, validation
succeeds.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="script-execution">Script execution</h3>
<p>The execution rules for tapscript are based on those for P2WSH according
to BIP141, including the <code>OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY</code> and
<code>OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY</code> opcodes defined in
<a href="https://bips.dev/342/bip-0065.mediawiki" title="wikilink">BIP65</a> and
<a href="https://bips.dev/342/bip-0112.mediawiki" title="wikilink">BIP112</a>, but with the following
modifications:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disabled script opcodes</strong> The following script opcodes are
disabled in tapscript: <code>OP_CHECKMULTISIG</code> and
<code>OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY</code>[1]. The disabled opcodes behave in the
same way as <code>OP_RETURN</code>, by failing and terminating the script
immediately when executed, and being ignored when found in
unexecuted branch of the script.</li>
<li><strong>Consensus-enforced MINIMALIF</strong> The MINIMALIF rules, which are only
a standardness rule in P2WSH, are consensus enforced in tapscript.
This means that the input argument to the <code>OP_IF</code> and <code>OP_NOTIF</code>
opcodes must be either exactly 0 (the empty vector) or exactly 1
(the one-byte vector with value 1)[2].</li>
<li><strong>OP_SUCCESSx opcodes</strong> As listed above, some opcodes are renamed
to <code>OP_SUCCESSx</code>, and make the script unconditionally valid.</li>
<li><strong>Signature opcodes</strong>. The <code>OP_CHECKSIG</code> and <code>OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY</code> are
modified to operate on Schnorr public keys and signatures (see
<a href="https://bips.dev/342/bip-0340.mediawiki" title="wikilink">BIP340</a>) instead of ECDSA, and a new
opcode <code>OP_CHECKSIGADD</code> is added.
<ul>
<li>The opcode 186 (<code>0xba</code>) is named as <code>OP_CHECKSIGADD</code>.
[3]<ref><strong>Alternatives to <code>CHECKMULTISIG</code></strong> There are multiple
ways of implementing a threshold <em>k</em>-of-<em>n</em> policy using Taproot
and Tapscript:</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Using a single <code>OP_CHECKSIGADD</code>-based script</strong> A <code>CHECKMULTISIG</code>
script <code>m </code>&lt;pubkey_1&gt;<code> ... </code>&lt;pubkey_n&gt;<code> n CHECKMULTISIG</code> with
witness <code>0 </code>&lt;signature_1&gt;<code> ... </code>&lt;signature_m&gt; can be rewritten
as script &lt;pubkey_1&gt;<code> CHECKSIG </code>&lt;pubkey_2&gt;<code> CHECKSIGADD ...
    </code>&lt;pubkey_n&gt;<code> CHECKSIGADD m NUMEQUAL</code> with witness &lt;w_n&gt;<code> ...
    </code>&lt;w_1&gt;. Every witness element <code>w_i</code> is either a signature
corresponding to <code>pubkey_i</code> or an empty vector. A similar
<code>CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY</code> script can be translated to BIP342 by
replacing <code>NUMEQUAL</code> with <code>NUMEQUALVERIFY</code>. This approach has very
similar characteristics to the existing <code>OP_CHECKMULTISIG</code>-based
scripts.</li>
<li><strong>Using a <em>k</em>-of-<em>k</em> script for every combination</strong> A <em>k</em>-of-<em>n</em>
policy can be implemented by splitting the script into several
leaves of the Merkle tree, each implementing a <em>k</em>-of-<em>k</em> policy
using &lt;pubkey_1&gt;<code> CHECKSIGVERIFY ... &lt;pubkey_(n-1)&gt; CHECKSIGVERIFY
    </code>&lt;pubkey_n&gt;<code> CHECKSIG</code>. This may be preferable for privacy
reasons over the previous approach, as it only exposes the
participating public keys, but it is only more cost effective for
small values of <em>k</em> (1-of-<em>n</em> for any <em>n</em>, 2-of-<em>n</em> for <em>n ≥ 6</em>,
3-of-<em>n</em> for <em>n ≥ 9</em>, ...). Furthermore, the signatures here commit
to the branch used, which means signers need to be aware of which
other signers will be participating, or produce signatures for each
of the tree leaves.</li>
<li><strong>Using an aggregated public key for every combination</strong> Instead of
building a tree where every leaf consists of <em>k</em> public keys, it is
possible instead build a tree where every leaf contains a single
<em>aggregate</em> of those <em>k</em> keys using
<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/068">MuSig</a>. This approach is far more
efficient, but does require a 3-round interactive signing protocol
to jointly produce the (single) signature.</li>
<li><strong>Native Schnorr threshold signatures</strong> Multisig policies can also
be realized with <a href="http://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/techreports/2001/corr2001-13.ps">threshold
signatures</a>
using verifiable secret sharing. This results in outputs and inputs
that are indistinguishable from single-key payments, but at the cost
of needing an interactive protocol (and associated backup
procedures) before determining the address to send to.</ref></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rules-for-signature-opcodes">Rules for signature opcodes</h3>
<p>The following rules apply to <code>OP_CHECKSIG</code>, <code>OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY</code>, and
<code>OP_CHECKSIGADD</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>For <code>OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY</code> and <code>OP_CHECKSIG</code>, the public key (top
element) and a signature (second to top element) are popped from the
stack.
<ul>
<li>If fewer than 2 elements are on the stack, the script MUST fail
and terminate immediately.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For <code>OP_CHECKSIGADD</code>, the public key (top element), a <code>CScriptNum</code>
<code>n</code> (second to top element), and a signature (third to top element)
are popped from the stack.
<ul>
<li>If fewer than 3 elements are on the stack, the script MUST fail
and terminate immediately.</li>
<li>If <code>n</code> is larger than 4 bytes, the script MUST fail and
terminate immediately.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the public key size is zero, the script MUST fail and terminate
immediately.</li>
<li>If the public key size is 32 bytes, it is considered to be a public
key as described in BIP340:
<ul>
<li>If the signature is not the empty vector, the signature is
validated against the public key (see the next subsection).
Validation failure in this case immediately terminates script
execution with failure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the public key size is not zero and not 32 bytes, the public key
is of an <em>unknown public key type</em>[4] and no actual signature
verification is applied. During script execution of signature
opcodes they behave exactly as known public key types except that
signature validation is considered to be successful.</li>
<li>If the script did not fail and terminate before this step,
regardless of the public key type:
<ul>
<li>If the signature is the empty vector:
<ul>
<li>For <code>OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY</code>, the script MUST fail and terminate
immediately.</li>
<li>For <code>OP_CHECKSIG</code>, an empty vector is pushed onto the stack,
and execution continues with the next opcode.</li>
<li>For <code>OP_CHECKSIGADD</code>, a <code>CScriptNum</code> with value <code>n</code> is
pushed onto the stack, and execution continues with the next
opcode.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the signature is not the empty vector, the opcode is counted
towards the sigops budget (see further).
<ul>
<li>For <code>OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY</code>, execution continues without any
further changes to the stack.</li>
<li>For <code>OP_CHECKSIG</code>, a 1-byte value <code>0x01</code> is pushed onto the
stack.</li>
<li>For <code>OP_CHECKSIGADD</code>, a <code>CScriptNum</code> with value of <code>n + 1</code>
is pushed onto the stack.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="common-signature-message-extension">Common Signature Message Extension</h3>
<p>We define the tapscript message extension <em>ext</em> to <a href="https://bips.dev/342/bip-0341.mediawiki#common-signature-message" title="wikilink">BIP341 Common
Signature
Message</a>,
indicated by <em>ext_flag = 1</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>tapleaf_hash</em> (32): the tapleaf hash as defined in
<a href="https://bips.dev/342/bip-0341.mediawiki#design" title="wikilink">BIP341</a></li>
<li><em>key_version</em> (1): a constant value <em>0x00</em> representing the current
version of public keys in the tapscript signature opcode execution.</li>
<li><em>codesep_pos</em> (4): the opcode position of the last executed
<code>OP_CODESEPARATOR</code> before the currently executed signature opcode,
with the value in little endian (or <em>0xffffffff</em> if none executed).
The first opcode in a script has a position of 0. A multi-byte push
opcode is counted as one opcode, regardless of the size of data
being pushed. Opcodes in parsed but unexecuted branches count
towards this value as well.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="signature-validation">Signature validation</h3>
<p>To validate a signature <em>sig</em> with public key <em>p</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compute the tapscript message extension <em>ext</em> described above.</li>
<li>If the <em>sig</em> is 64 bytes long, return <em>Verify(p,
hash<sub>TapSighash</sub>(0x00 || SigMsg(0x00, 1) || ext), sig)</em>,
where <em>Verify</em> is defined in
<a href="https://bips.dev/342/bip-0340.mediawiki#design" title="wikilink">BIP340</a>.</li>
<li>If the <em>sig</em> is 65 bytes long, return <em>sig[64] ≠ 0x00 and
Verify(p, hash<sub>TapSighash</sub>(0x00 || SigMsg(sig[64], 1) ||
ext), sig[0:64])</em>.</li>
<li>Otherwise, fail.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, the semantics of signature validation is identical to
BIP340, except the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>The signature message includes the tapscript-specific data
<em>key_version</em>.[5]</li>
<li>The signature message commits to the executed script through the
<em>tapleaf_hash</em> which includes the leaf version and script instead
of <em>scriptCode</em>. This implies that this commitment is unaffected by
<code>OP_CODESEPARATOR</code>.</li>
<li>The signature message includes the opcode position of the last
executed <code>OP_CODESEPARATOR</code>.[6]</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="resource-limits">Resource limits</h3>
<p>In addition to changing the semantics of a number of opcodes, there are
also some changes to the resource limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Script size limit</strong> The maximum script size of 10000 bytes does
not apply. Their size is only implicitly bounded by the block weight
limit.[7]</li>
<li><strong>Non-push opcodes limit</strong> The maximum non-push opcodes limit of 201
per script does not apply.[8]</li>
<li><strong>Sigops limit</strong> The sigops in tapscripts do not count towards the
block-wide limit of 80000 (weighted). Instead, there is a per-script
sigops <em>budget</em>. The budget equals 50 + the total serialized size in
bytes of the transaction input's witness (including the
<code>CompactSize</code> prefix). Executing a signature opcode (<code>OP_CHECKSIG</code>,
<code>OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY</code>, or <code>OP_CHECKSIGADD</code>) with a non-empty signature
decrements the budget by 50. If that brings the budget below zero,
the script fails immediately. Signature opcodes with unknown public
key type and non-empty signature are also counted.[9][10][11].</li>
<li><strong>Stack + altstack element count limit</strong> The existing limit of 1000
elements in the stack and altstack together after every executed
opcode remains. It is extended to also apply to the size of initial
stack.</li>
<li><strong>Stack element size limit</strong> The existing limit of maximum 520 bytes
per stack element remains, both in the initial stack and in push
opcodes.</li>
</ul>

<p>This document is the result of many discussions and contains
contributions by a number of people. The authors wish to thank all those
who provided valuable feedback and reviews, including the participants
of the <a href="https://github.com/ajtowns/taproot-review">structured reviews</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Why are <code>OP_CHECKMULTISIG</code> and <code>OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY</code> disabled,
and not turned into OP_SUCCESSx?</strong> This is a precaution to make
sure people who accidentally keep using <code>OP_CHECKMULTISIG</code> in
Tapscript notice a problem immediately. It also avoids the
complication of script disassemblers needing to become
context-dependent.</li>
<li><strong>Why make MINIMALIF consensus?</strong> This makes it considerably easier
to write non-malleable scripts that take branch information from the
stack.</li>
<li><strong><code>OP_CHECKSIGADD</code></strong> This opcode is added to compensate for the loss
of <code>OP_CHECKMULTISIG</code>-like opcodes, which are incompatible with
batch verification. <code>OP_CHECKSIGADD</code> is functionally equivalent to
<code>OP_ROT OP_SWAP OP_CHECKSIG OP_ADD</code>, but only takes 1 byte. All
<code>CScriptNum</code>-related behaviours of <code>OP_ADD</code> are also applicable to
<code>OP_CHECKSIGADD</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Unknown public key types</strong> allow adding new signature validation
rules through softforks. A softfork could add actual signature
validation which either passes or makes the script fail and
terminate immediately. This way, new <code>SIGHASH</code> modes can be added,
as well as <a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2018-December/016549.html">NOINPUT-tagged public
keys</a>
and a public key constant which is replaced by the taproot internal
key for signature validation.</li>
<li><strong>Why does the signature message commit to the <em>key_version</em>?</strong>
This is for future extensions that define unknown public key types,
making sure signatures can't be moved from one key type to another.</li>
<li><strong>Why does the signature message include the position of the last
executed <code>OP_CODESEPARATOR</code>?</strong> This allows continuing to use
<code>OP_CODESEPARATOR</code> to sign the executed path of the script. Because
the <code>codeseparator_position</code> is the last input to the hash, the
SHA256 midstate can be efficiently cached for multiple
<code>OP_CODESEPARATOR</code>s in a single script. In contrast, the BIP143
handling of <code>OP_CODESEPARATOR</code> is to commit to the executed script
only from the last executed <code>OP_CODESEPARATOR</code> onwards which
requires unnecessary rehashing of the script. It should be noted
that the one known <code>OP_CODESEPARATOR</code> use case of saving a second
public key push in a script by sharing the first one between two
code branches can be most likely expressed even cheaper by moving
each branch into a separate taproot leaf.</li>
<li><strong>Why is a limit on script size no longer needed?</strong> Since there is
no <code>scriptCode</code> directly included in the signature hash (only
indirectly through a precomputable tapleaf hash), the CPU time spent
on a signature check is no longer proportional to the size of the
script being executed.</li>
<li><strong>Why is a limit on the number of opcodes no longer needed?</strong> An
opcode limit only helps to the extent that it can prevent data
structures from growing unboundedly during execution (both because
of memory usage, and because of time that may grow in proportion to
the size of those structures). The size of stack and altstack is
already independently limited. By using O(1) logic for <code>OP_IF</code>,
<code>OP_NOTIF</code>, <code>OP_ELSE</code>, and <code>OP_ENDIF</code> as suggested
<a href="https://bitslog.com/2017/04/17/new-quadratic-delays-in-bitcoin-scripts/">here</a>
and implemented
<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16902">here</a>, the only
other instance can be avoided as well.</li>
<li><strong>The tapscript sigop limit</strong> The signature opcode limit protects
against scripts which are slow to verify due to excessively many
signature operations. In tapscript the number of signature opcodes
does not count towards the BIP141 or legacy sigop limit. The old
sigop limit makes transaction selection in block construction
unnecessarily difficult because it is a second constraint in
addition to weight. Instead, the number of tapscript signature
opcodes is limited by witness weight. Additionally, the limit
applies to the transaction input instead of the block and only
actually executed signature opcodes are counted. Tapscript execution
allows one signature opcode per 50 witness weight units plus one
free signature opcode.</li>
<li><strong>Parameter choice of the sigop limit</strong> Regular witnesses are
unaffected by the limit as their weight is composed of public key
and (<code>SIGHASH_ALL</code>) signature pairs with <em>33 + 65</em> weight units each
(which includes a 1 weight unit <code>CompactSize</code> tag). This is also the
case if public keys are reused in the script because a signature's
weight alone is 65 or 66 weight units. However, the limit increases
the fees of abnormal scripts with duplicate signatures (and public
keys) by requiring additional weight. The weight per sigop factor 50
corresponds to the ratio of BIP141 block limits: 4 mega weight units
divided by 80,000 sigops. The &quot;free&quot; signature opcode permitted by
the limit exists to account for the weight of the non-witness parts
of the transaction input.</li>
<li><strong>Why are only signature opcodes counted toward the budget, and not
for example hashing opcodes or other expensive operations?</strong> It
turns out that the CPU cost per witness byte for verification of a
script consisting of the maximum density of signature checking
opcodes (taking the 50 WU/sigop limit into account) is already very
close to that of scripts packed with other opcodes, including
hashing opcodes (taking the 520 byte stack element limit into
account) and <code>OP_ROLL</code> (taking the 1000 stack element limit into
account). That said, the construction is very flexible, and allows
adding new signature opcodes like <code>CHECKSIGFROMSTACK</code> to count
towards the limit through a soft fork. Even if in the future new
opcodes are introduced which change normal script cost there is no
need to stuff the witness with meaningless data. Instead, the
taproot annex can be used to add weight to the witness without
increasing the actual witness size.</li>
