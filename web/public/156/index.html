<p>Bitcoin's transaction spreading protocol is vulnerable to
deanonymization attacks. Dandelion is a transaction routing mechanism
that provides formal anonymity guarantees against these attacks. When a
node generates a transaction without Dandelion, it transmits that
transaction to its peers with independent, exponential delays. This
approach, known as diffusion in academia, allows network adversaries to
link transactions to IP addresses.</p>
<p>Dandelion mitigates this class of attacks by sending transactions over a
randomly selected path before diffusion. Transactions travel along this
path during the &quot;stem phase&quot; and are then diffused during the &quot;fluff
phase&quot; (hence Dandelion). We have shown that this routing protocol
provides near-optimal anonymity guarantees among schemes that do not
introduce additional encryption mechanisms.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Transaction diffusion in Bitcoin is vulnerable to deanonymization
attacks. Because transactions are sent to peers with independent,
exponential delays, messages spread through the network in a
statistically symmetric manner. This pattern allows colluding spy nodes
to infer the transaction source. Breaking this symmetry prevents the
attack. However, we have shown that an adversary with knowledge of the
network topology can launch a much more effective &quot;fingerprint&quot; attack
if the symmetry breaking is not done properly.</p>
<p>Consider a botnet-style adversary with access to the P2P graph. Botnets
of size comparable to the Bitcoin P2P network are common and cheap, and
these adversaries can learn the network structure with probe messages.
We have shown that such an adversary can achieve total deanonymization
of the entire network after observing less than ten transactions per
node.</p>
<p>Dandelion is a practical, lightweight privacy solution that provides the
Bitcoin network formal anonymity guarantees. While other privacy
solutions aim to protect individual users, Dandelion protects anonymity
by limiting the capability of adversaries to deanonymize the entire
network.</p>
<h2 id="how-dandelion-works">How Dandelion Works</h2>
<p>Dandelion enhances user privacy by sending transactions through an
anonymity phase before diffusing them throughout the network. At a high
level, Dandelion enhances privacy by (i) breaking the symmetry of
diffusion and (ii) mixing transactions by forwarding messages from
different sources along the same path.</p>
<p>Dandelion routing can be conceptualized in three phases. First, a
privacy graph is constructed. In practice, this privacy graph is
constructed in a fully decentralized manner and is a subgraph of the
existing Bitcoin P2P network. Next, transactions are forwarded along
this privacy graph during the &quot;stem phase.&quot; Finally, messages are
broadcast to the network during the &quot;fluff phase&quot; using the typical
method of diffusion.</p>
<p><a href="File:bip-0156/1-dandelion.png" title="wikilink">framed|center|alt=An illustration of Dandelion routing|Figure
1</a> Figure 1</p>
<p>In order to select the privacy graph in a decentralized manner, each
node selects a subset of its outbound peers to be Dandelion
destinations. Dandelion transactions (transactions in their stem phase)
that arrive at this node via inbound connections are forwarded to these
Dandelion destinations.</p>
<p>In an ideal setting, we have found that a Hamiltonian circuit provides
near-optimal privacy guarantees. However, constructing a Hamiltonian
circuit through the Bitcoin P2P network in a decentralized, trustless
manner is not feasible. Thus, we recommend that each node select two
Dandelion destinations uniformly at random without replacement from its
list of outbound peers. Our tests have shown that this method provides
comparable privacy with increased robustness.</p>
<p>During stem phase routing, there is a question of how to route messages
in order to protect privacy. For example, if two Dandelion transactions
arrive at a node from different inbound peers, to which Dandelion
destination(s) should these transactions be sent? We have found that
some choices are much better than others.</p>
<p>Consider the case in which each Dandelion transaction is forwarded to a
Dandelion destination selected uniformly at random. This approach
results in a fingerprint attack allowing network-level botnet
adversaries to achieve total deanonymization of the P2P network after
observing less than ten transactions per node.</p>
<p><a href="File:bip-0156/2-attack.png" title="wikilink">framed|center|alt=An illustration of a fingerprint attack|Figure
2</a> Figure 2</p>
<p>During a fingerprint attack, a botnet-style adversary with knowledge of
the graph structure first simulates transaction propagation. This
offline step lets the adversary generate fingerprints for each network
node. During the online attack, the adversary collects transactions at
its spy nodes and matches these observations to the simulated
fingerprints. Our simulations have shown that this attack results in
devastating, network-wide deanonymization.</p>
<p><a href="File:bip-0156/3-attack-plot.png" title="wikilink">framed|center|alt=A plot illustrating total deanonymization|Figure
3</a> Figure 3</p>
<p>To avoid this issue, we suggest &quot;per-inbound-edge&quot; routing. Each inbound
peer is assigned a particular Dandelion destination. Each Dandelion
transaction that arrives via this peer is forwarded to the same
Dandelion destination. Per-inbound-edge routing breaks the described
attack by blocking an adversary's ability to construct useful
fingerprints. Fingerprints arise when routing decisions are made
independently per transaction at each node. In this case, two
transactions from the same node generally take different paths through
the network. Crucially, this results in multiple, unique data points
that are aggregated to match with a fingerprint.</p>
<p>Dandelion ensures that two transactions from the same node take the same
network path, limiting adversaries to the far-left of the graph in
Figure 3. In other words, adversary knowledge is limited to the case of
one observed message rather than a rich profile of multiple transaction
paths. Dandelion also breaks the symmetry of diffusion, making the
source of the transaction difficult to infer.</p>
<p><a href="File:bip-0156/4-dandelion-plot.png" title="wikilink">framed|center|alt=A plot illustrating limited deanonymization|Figure
4</a> Figure 4</p>
<p>After a transaction has traveled along a Dandelion stem for a random
number of hops, it transitions into the fluff phase of routing. The
transaction is shared with the network through the existing process of
diffusion. In practice, this fluff mechanism is enforced by a weighted
coin flip at each node. If the random value is below some threshold, the
Dandelion transaction is transformed into a typical transaction. In our
testing, we have chosen a probability of ten percent that a given
Dandelion transaction enters fluff phase when leaving a given node. This
value strikes a good balance between stem path length and transaction
spreading latency.</p>
<p>Note that Dandelion's expected precision guarantees are a
population-level metric, whereas the expected recall guarantees can be
interpreted as an individual-level metric. Expected recall is equivalent
to the probability that an adversary associates a single transaction
with a given source. These guarantees are probabilistic. They do not
address scenarios in which a node has been eclipsed by other nodes, or
when a node is specifically targeted by an ISP-like adversary.
Individuals who are concerned about targeted deanonymization should
still use Tor.</p>
<p>At a high level, Dandelion is like an &quot;anonymity inoculation&quot; for the
public at large - including users who are not aware of Bitcoin's privacy
issues. Higher adoption leads to greater benefits, even for users who do
not use Tor. Early adopters of Dandelion still receive privacy benefits.
In the worst case when no neighbors support Dandelion, transactions make
at least one hop before diffusing. Note that any solution based only on
routing cannot be perfectly anonymous due to the fundamental lower
bounds on precision and recall shown in the original Dandelion paper.
Dandelion provides near-optimal anonymity guarantees among such
solutions.</p>
<h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>
<p>Dandelion can be specified with a handful of features: Dandelion
transaction support, Dandelion routing data and logic, periodic
Dandelion route shuffling, memory pool logic, the fluff mechanism,
transaction embargoes, and Dandelion transaction logic. Specification
details are summarized below.</p>
<h3 id="dandelion-transaction-support">Dandelion transaction support</h3>
<p>During the stem phase, transactions are &quot;Dandelion transactions.&quot; When a
Dandelion transaction enters fluff phase, it becomes a typical Bitcoin
transaction. Dandelion transactions and typical transactions differ only
in their <code>NetMsgType</code>.</p>
<p>Dandelion (stem phase) transactions MUST be differentiable from typical
Bitcoin transactions.</p>
<h3 id="dandelion-routing-data-and-logic">Dandelion routing data and logic</h3>
<p>Dandelion routing during the stem phase requires notions of inbound
peers, outbound peers, Dandelion destinations, and Dandelion routes.
Inbound peers consist of all currently connected peers that initiated
the peer connection. Outbound peers consist of all currently connected
peers that were connected to by this node. Dandelion destinations are a
subset of outbound peers. The number of Dandelion destinations is
limited by the <code>DANDELION_MAX_DESTINATIONS</code> parameter. In the reference
implementation, this parameter is set to two. Our tests have shown that
this value provides both privacy and robustness (see the reference paper
for more details on the parameter tradeoffs). Dandelion routes are a map
of inbound peers to Dandelion destinations. Every inbound peer is mapped
to a Dandelion destination.</p>
<p>Note that a Dandelion node may choose a different
<code>DANDELION_MAX_DESTINATIONS</code> parameter without splitting from the
privacy graph. When mapping inbound connections to outbound connections
for Dandelion routes, we implement the following routing logic. First,
select a set of Dandelion destinations from the set of outbound peers.
This set of Dandelion destinations is of size less than or equal to
<code>DANDELION_MAX_DESTINATIONS</code>. For each inbound connection, first
identify the subset of Dandelion destinations with the least number of
routes. For example, some subset of Dandelion destinations may be
affiliated with zero routes while all other Dandelion destinations are
affiliated with one or more routes. From this subset, select one
Dandelion destination uniformly at random. Establish a Dandelion route
from the inbound connection to this Dandelion destination.</p>
<p>For a given Dandelion routing epoch, two distinct Dandelion destinations
SHOULD be selected uniformly at random from the set of outbound
connections. All Dandelion transactions that arrive via a given inbound
connection MUST be transmitted to the same Dandelion destination. When
choosing a Dandelion destination for a given inbound connection, the
destination MUST be selected uniformly at random from the set of
Dandelion destinations with the least number of inbound connections
mapped to them.</p>
<h3 id="periodic-dandelion-route-shuffling">Periodic Dandelion route shuffling</h3>
<p>The map of Dandelion routes is cleared and reconstructed every ten
minutes on average. We have chosen the value of ten minutes
heuristically in order to make privacy graph learning difficult for
adversaries. Note that a Dandelion node may choose a different average
shuffle time without splitting from the privacy graph.</p>
<p>Dandelion routes MUST be cleared and reconstructed at random intervals.
Dandelion routes SHOULD be cleared and reconstructed every ten minutes
on average.</p>
<h3 id="memory-pool-logic">Memory pool logic</h3>
<p>Dandelion transactions are segregated from typical transactions. The
<code>mempool</code> remains unchanged. Another instance of the <code>CTxMemPool</code> class,
called the <code>stempool</code>, is used for Dandelion transactions. Information
flows from <code>mempool</code> to <code>stempool</code> in order to ensure proper transaction
propagation. Information does not flow from <code>stempool</code> to <code>mempool</code>,
except when a Dandelion transaction fluffs into a typical transaction.</p>
<p>When a Dandelion transaction arrives, the transaction MUST be added to
the stempool and MUST NOT be added to the mempool. When a typical
Bitcoin transaction arrives, the transaction MUST be added to the
mempool and MUST be added to the stempool. When a Dandelion transaction
fluffs, the transaction MUST be added to the mempool.</p>
<h3 id="the-fluff-mechanism">The fluff mechanism</h3>
<p>When relaying a Dandelion transaction along a Dandelion route, there is
a 10% chance that the Dandelion transaction becomes a typical Bitcoin
transaction and is therefore relayed via diffusion. In our testing, this
value strikes a good balance between stem path length and transaction
spreading latency. Note that a Dandelion node may choose a different
chance of fluffing without splitting from the privacy graph.</p>
<p>When a node prepares to transmit a Dandelion transaction, the node MUST
flip a biased coin. If the outcome is &quot;Dandelion transaction,&quot; then the
node MUST transmit the transaction to the appropriate Dandelion
destination. Otherwise, the node MUST convert the Dandelion transaction
into a typical Bitcoin transaction. A Dandelion transaction SHOULD fluff
into a typical Bitcoin transaction with a 10% probability.</p>
<h3 id="transaction-embargoes">Transaction embargoes</h3>
<p>During the stem phase, transactions are relayed along a single path. If
any node in this path were to receive the Dandelion transaction and go
offline, then the transaction would cease to propagate. To increase
robustness, every node that forwards a Dandelion transaction initializes
a timer at the time of reception. If the Dandelion transaction does not
appear in the memory pool by the time the timer expires, then the
transaction enters fluff phase and is forwarded via diffusion.</p>
<p>When a Dandelion transaction arrives, the node MUST set an embargo timer
for a random time in the future. If the Dandelion transaction arrives as
a typical Bitcoin transaction, the node MUST cancel the timer. If the
timer expires before the Dandelion transaction is observed as a typical
Bitcoin transaction, then the node MUST fluff the Dandelion transaction.</p>
<h3 id="dandelion-transaction-logic">Dandelion transaction logic</h3>
<p>The following cases define a node's behavior when receiving network
packets referencing Dandelion transactions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Receive INV for Dandelion TX: If the peer is inbound and the
Dandelion transaction has not been received from this peer, then
reply with GETDATA.</li>
<li>Receive GETDATA for Dandelion TX: If the peer is not inbound and the
Dandelion transaction has been advertised to this peer, then reply
with the Dandelion transaction.</li>
<li>Receive Dandelion TX: If the peer is inbound, then relay the
Dandelion TX to the appropriate Dandelion destination.</li>
</ul>

URL: <a href="https://github.com/dandelion-org/bitcoin/tree/dandelion">https://github.com/dandelion-org/bitcoin/tree/dandelion</a></p>
<h2 id="compatibility">Compatibility</h2>
<p>Dandelion does not conflict with existing versions of Bitcoin. A Bitcoin
node that supports Dandelion appears no differently to Bitcoin nodes
running older software versions. Bitcoin nodes that support Dandelion
can identify feature support through a probe message. Obviously, older
nodes are not capable of Dandelion routing. If a Bitcoin node supporting
Dandelion has no peers that also support Dandelion, then its behavior
naturally decays to that of a Bitcoin node without Dandelion support due
to the Dandelion transaction embargoes.</p>
