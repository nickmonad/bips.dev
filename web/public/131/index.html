</span></code></pre><h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This specification defines a new type of transaction that supplements
(not replaces) normal &quot;non coalescing&quot; bitcoin transactions.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Normal &quot;non-coalescing&quot; Bitcoin Transactions have one large
inefficiency: When you want to spend from multiple inputs with the exact
same scriptPubKey, you have to list each input separately, along with
the same signature multiple times, even though the signature expresses
the same information. This bloats the transaction size and makes it
expensive to spend from small value inputs.</p>
<p>Because small value inputs are expensive to send, they remain in the
UTXO pool which full nodes have to keep around. It is believed that long
term increase of the UTXO set can have negative scaling consequences on
the network.</p>
<p>If maximum blocksize is made to increase *slower* than the actual
number of transactions bitcoin users are sending to the network, this
problem is projected to get worse. In other words, as transaction fees
increase, the minimum economical value of a spending a UTXO will
increase.</p>
<h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>
<h3 id="redefinition-of-transaction-version">Redefinition of Transaction version</h3>
<p>First, this BIP redefines the version field on transactions. The first
four bytes are defined as the version number, while the last four bytes
are defined as the transaction type. Type &quot;0000&quot; denotes normal
transactions, and &quot;0001&quot; defines coalescing transaction.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>version 1 transaction with normal inputs:</p>
<p><code>   version: 10000000</code></p>
<p>version 2 transaction with normal inputs:</p>
<p><code>   version: 20000000</code></p>
<p>version 2 transaction with coalescing inputs:</p>
<p><code>   version: 20000001</code></p>
<p>Essentially the last bit in the version field is set to 1 to enable
wildcard inputs for all inputs present in the transaction.</p>
<h3 id="wildcard-inputs">Wildcard inputs</h3>
<p>A coalescing transaction is formulated the exact same way as a version 1
transaction with one exception: each input is treated as a &quot;wildcard
input&quot;.</p>
<p>A wildcard input beings the value of all inputs with the exact same
scriptPubKey in a block lower or equal to the block the wildcard input
is confirmed into.</p>
<h2 id="changes-needed-to-implement">Changes needed to implement</h2>
<p>The bitcoin code needs to be modified in three places in order to handle
Coalescing Transactions.</p>
<p>1. <b>Full Node Coalescing validation</b> - When a full node receives a
coalescing transaction, it has to aggregate the value of all the UTXOs
in the blockchain older than the input with the same scriptPubKey. If
this value is greater than or equal to the amount of all outputs, then
that coalescing transaction is valid and can be propagated.</p>
<p>2. <b>Full Node Non-Coalescing validation</b> - When a non-coalescing
transaction comes in, the code needs to be modified to check if each
input has not been spent by a coalescing transaction. If there exist any
coalescing transaction in the blockchain with the same scriptPubKey
found in a block *after* that input, then the UTXO has been spent and
the transaction is invalid.</p>
<p>3. <b>Wallet</b> - The user facing wallet portion of the reference
client should notify the user when their wallet contains many UTXOs that
qualify it to benefit from a coalescing transaction. Wallets should not
simply replace non-coalescing transactions with coalescing transactions
in all instances.</p>
<h2 id="isn-t-this-bip-bad-because-it-encourage-address-re-use">Isn't this BIP bad because it encourage address re-use?</h2>
<p>Address re-use comes in two forms: re-use by the <em>sender</em>, and re-use by
the <em>receiver</em>.</p>
<p>Re-use by the sender is basically using the same address for the change
output. This is generally considered bad since people looking through
your transaction history can determine who you do business with. When
you generate a new address for every change, your privacy is conserved
as it is impossible to know which output is a recipient, and which
output is the change output. This BIP has <strong>no effect</strong> on re-use by the
sender.</p>
<p>On the other hand, address re-use by the <em>receiver</em> occurs under
completely different circumstances. When you publish an address and have
multiple people send to that address, you are engaging in address re-use
from the receiver. This activity has historically been considered bad
because it leads to re-using a private key. When you re-use a private
key too many times, you run the risk of an attacker performing
statistical analysis on the multiple signatures, which can lead to an
attacker finding out your private key.</p>
<p>This BIP introduces a way to spend multiple inputs <em>without</em> re-using
the private key. In a sense, this BIP fixes the problem that makes
address re-use bad for the receiver. After this BIP becomes implemented
and deployed, address re-use by the receiver will no longer be
considered bad form.</p>
