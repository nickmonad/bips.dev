<p>Many nodes today will not replace any transaction in their mempool with
another transaction that spends the same inputs, making it difficult for
spenders to adjust their previously-sent transactions to deal with
unexpected confirmation delays or to perform other useful replacements.</p>
<p>The opt-in full Replace-by-Fee (opt-in full-RBF) signaling policy
described here allows spenders to add a signal to a transaction
indicating that they want to be able to replace that transaction in the
future. In response to this signal,</p>
<ul>
<li>Nodes may allow transactions containing this signal to be replaced
in their mempools.</li>
</ul>
<!-- end list -->
<ul>
<li>The recipient or recipients of a transaction containing this signal
may choose not to treat it as payment until it has been confirmed,
eliminating the risk that the spender will use allowed replacements
to defraud them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nodes and recipients may continue to treat transactions without the
signal the same way they treated them before, preserving the existing
status quo.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>This policy specifies two ways a transaction can signal that it is
replaceable.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explicit signaling:</strong> A transaction is considered to have opted in
to allowing replacement of itself if any of its inputs have an
nSequence number less than (0xffffffff - 1).</li>
</ul>
<!-- end list -->
<ul>
<li><strong>Inherited signaling:</strong> Transactions that don't explicitly signal
replaceability are replaceable under this policy for as long as any
one of their ancestors signals replaceability and remains
unconfirmed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="implementation-details">Implementation Details</h3>
<p>The initial implementation expected in Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 uses the
following rules:</p>
<p>One or more transactions currently in the mempool (original
transactions) will be replaced by a new transaction (replacement
transaction) that spends one or more of the same inputs if,</p>
<ol>
<li>The original transactions signal replaceability explicitly or
through inheritance as described in the above Summary section.</li>
</ol>
<!-- end list -->
<ol>
<li>The replacement transaction may only include an unconfirmed input if
that input was included in one of the original transactions. (An
unconfirmed input spends an output from a currently-unconfirmed
transaction.)</li>
</ol>
<!-- end list -->
<ol>
<li>The replacement transaction pays an absolute fee of at least the sum
paid by the original transactions.</li>
</ol>
<!-- end list -->
<ol>
<li>The replacement transaction must also pay for its own bandwidth at
or above the rate set by the node's minimum relay fee setting. For
example, if the minimum relay fee is 1 satoshi/byte and the
replacement transaction is 500 bytes total, then the replacement
must pay a fee at least 500 satoshis higher than the sum of the
originals.</li>
</ol>
<!-- end list -->
<ol>
<li>The number of original transactions to be replaced and their
descendant transactions which will be evicted from the mempool must
not exceed a total of 100 transactions.</li>
</ol>
<p>The initial implementation may be seen in <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6871">Bitcoin Core
PR#6871</a> and specifically
the master branch commits from 5891f870d68d90408aa5ce5b597fb574f2d2cbca
to 16a2f93629f75d182871f288f0396afe6cdc8504 (inclusive).</p>
<h3 id="receiving-wallet-policy">Receiving wallet policy</h3>
<p>Wallets that display unconfirmed transactions to users or that provide
data about unconfirmed transactions to automated systems should consider
doing one of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Conveying additional suspicion about opt-in full-RBF transactions to
the user or data consumer.</li>
</ol>
<!-- end list -->
<ol>
<li>Ignoring the opt-in transaction until it has been confirmed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Because descendant transactions may also be replaceable under this
policy through inherited signaling, any method used to process opt-in
full-RBF transactions should be inherited by any descendant transactions
for as long as any ancestor opt-in full-RBF transactions remain
unconfirmed.</p>
<h3 id="spending-wallet-policy">Spending wallet policy</h3>
<p>Wallets that don't want to signal replaceability should use either a max
sequence number (0xffffffff) or a sequence number of (0xffffffff-1) when
they also want to use locktime; all known wallets currently do this.
They should also take care not to spend any unconfirmed transaction that
signals replaceability explicitly or through inherited signaling; most
wallets also currently do this by not spending any unconfirmed
transactions except for those they created themselves.</p>
<p>Wallets that do want to make replacements should use explicit signaling
and meet the criteria described above in the Implementation Details
section. A <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction_replacement">Bitcoin Wiki
page</a> has been
created to help wallet authors track deployed mempool policies relating
to transaction replacement.</p>
<p>The initial implementation makes use of P2P protocol reject messages for
rejected replacements, allowing P2P clients to determine whether their
replacements were initially accepted by their peers. Standard P2P
lightweight client practice of sending to some peers while listening for
relays from other peers should allow clients to determine whether the
replacement has propagated.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Satoshi Nakamoto's original Bitcoin implementation provided the
nSequence number field in each input to <a href="https://github.com/trottier/original-bitcoin/blob/master/src/main.cpp#L434">allow
replacement</a>
of transactions containing that input within the mempool. When receiving
replacements, nodes were supposed to replace transactions whose inputs
had lower sequence numbers with transactions that had higher sequence
numbers.</p>
<p>In that implementation, replacement transactions did not have to pay
additional fees, so there was no direct incentive for miners to include
the replacement and no built-in rate limiting that prevented overuse of
relay node bandwidth. Nakamoto <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/05454818dc7ed92f577a1a1ef6798049f17a52e7#diff-118fcbaaba162ba17933c7893247df3aR522">removed
replacement</a>
from Bitcoin version 0.3.12, leaving only the comment, &quot;Disable
replacement feature for now&quot;.</p>
<p>Replacing transactions with higher-fee transactions provided a way for
spenders to align their desires with miners, but by the time a
Replace-by-Fee (RBF) patch was available to re-enable replacement, some
receivers had begun to expect that the first version of a transaction
they saw was highly likely to be the version of the transaction to be
confirmed, and so some users advocated that replacement should be
disallowed.</p>
<p>To address those concerns, a variation on RBF was created that required
that the replacement transaction pay all of same outputs as the original
transaction in equal or greater amount. This was called RBF First Seen
Safe (RBF-FSS), and the original RBF became known as full-RBF. Although
agreeable to recipients who relied on the first-seen version of a
transaction, each use of RBF-FSS required adding an extra input to a
transaction, resulting in wallets being unable to use it if they had no
spare inputs, a loss of privacy when inputs from different origins get
used in the same transaction, and a wasteful increase in transaction
byte size.</p>
<p>Opt-in full-RBF uses Nakamoto's original semantics (with a slight tweak
to allow locktime users to opt-out) to signal that replacement is
possible, providing first-seen users with the ability to ignore those
transactions while also allowing for the efficiency benefits of
full-RBF.</p>
<p>There are no known problematic interactions between opt-in full-RBF and
other uses of nSequence. Specifically, opt-in full-RBF is compatible
with consensus-enforced locktime as provided in the Bitcoin 0.1
implementation, draft BIP68 (Relative lock-time using consensus-enforced
sequence numbers), and draft BIP112 (CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY).</p>
<h2 id="deployment">Deployment</h2>
<p>Now, and since Bitcoin's first release, 100% of the network hash rate
mines transactions using opt-in full-RBF semantics (sequence less than
(0xffffffff - 1)).</p>
<p>Opt-in full-RBF as a default mempool replacement policy among nodes and
miners is expected to become widespread as they upgrade to Bitcoin Core
0.12.0 (release expected Jan/Feb 2016) and similar node software such as
Bitcoin LJR.</p>
<p>Actual replacement may be unreliable until two conditions have been
satisfied:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enough nodes have upgraded to support it, providing a relay path for
replacements to go from spending wallets to miners controlling
significant amounts of hash rate.</li>
</ol>
<!-- end list -->
<ol>
<li>Enough hash rate has upgraded to support replacement, allowing for
reasonable probability that a replacement can be mined.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="backwards-compatibility">Backwards compatibility</h2>
<p>At the time opt-in RBF support was added/proposed, no known wallet
created transactions by default with nSequence set below (0xffffffff -
1), so no known wallet explicitly signaled replaceability by default.
Also no known popular wallet spent other users' unconfirmed transactions
by default, so no known wallets signaled inherited replaceability.</p>
