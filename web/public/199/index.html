</span></code></pre><h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This BIP describes a script for generalized off-chain contract
negotiation.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>A Hashed Time-Locked Contract (HTLC) is a script that permits a
designated party (the &quot;seller&quot;) to spend funds by disclosing the
preimage of a hash. It also permits a second party (the &quot;buyer&quot;) to
spend the funds after a timeout is reached, in a refund situation.</p>
<p>The script takes the following form:</p>
<p><code>   OP_IF</code><br />
<code>       [HASHOP] </code><digest><code> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_DUP OP_HASH160 </code><seller pubkey hash><code>            </code><br />
<code>   OP_ELSE</code><br />
<code>       </code><num><code> [TIMEOUTOP] OP_DROP OP_DUP OP_HASH160 </code><buyer pubkey hash><br />
<code>   OP_ENDIF</code><br />
<code>   OP_EQUALVERIFY</code><br />
<code>   OP_CHECKSIG</code></p>
<p>[HASHOP] is either OP_SHA256 or OP_HASH160.</p>
<p>[TIMEOUTOP] is either OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY or
OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY.</p>
<h3 id="interaction">Interaction</h3>
<ul>
<li>Victor (the &quot;buyer&quot;) and Peggy (the &quot;seller&quot;) exchange public keys
and mutually agree upon a timeout threshold. Peggy provides a hash
digest. Both parties can now construct the script and P2SH address
for the HTLC.</li>
<li>Victor sends funds to the P2SH address.</li>
<li>Either:
<ul>
<li>Peggy spends the funds, and in doing so, reveals the preimage to
Victor in the transaction; OR</li>
<li>Victor recovers the funds after the timeout threshold.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Victor is interested in a lower timeout to reduce the amount of time
that his funds are encumbered in the event that Peggy does not reveal
the preimage. Peggy is interested in a higher timeout to reduce the risk
that she is unable to spend the funds before the threshold, or worse,
that her transaction spending the funds does not enter the blockchain
before Victor's but does reveal the preimage to Victor anyway.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>In many off-chain protocols, secret disclosure is used as part of a
settlement mechanism. In some others, the secrets themselves are
valuable. HTLC transactions are a safe and cheap method of exchanging
secrets for money over the blockchain, due to the ability to recover
funds from an uncooperative counterparty, and the opportunity that the
possessor of a secret has to receive the funds before such a refund can
occur.</p>
<h3 id="lightning-network">Lightning network</h3>
<p>In the lightning network, HTLC scripts are used to perform atomic swaps
between payment channels.</p>
<p>Alice constructs K and hashes it to produce L. She sends an HTLC payment
to Bob for the preimage of L. Bob sends an HTLC payment to Carol for the
same preimage and amount. Only when Alice releases the preimage K does
any exchange of value occur, and because the secret is divulged for each
hop, all parties are compensated. If at any point some parties become
uncooperative, the process can be aborted via the refund conditions.</p>
<h3 id="zero-knowledge-contingent-payments">Zero-knowledge contingent payments</h3>
<p>Various practical zero-knowledge proving systems exist which can be used
to guarantee that a hash preimage derives valuable information. As an
example, a zero-knowledge proof can be used to prove that a hash
preimage acts as a decryption key for an encrypted sudoku puzzle
solution. (See <a href="https://github.com/zcash/pay-to-sudoku">pay-to-sudoku</a>
for a concrete example of such a protocol.)</p>
<p>HTLC transactions can be used to exchange such decryption keys for money
without risk, and they do not require large or expensive-to-validate
transactions.</p>
