<p>This BIP describes a structure for compact filters on block data, for
use in the BIP 157 light client protocol[1]. The filter construction
proposed is an alternative to Bloom filters, as used in BIP 37, that
minimizes filter size by using Golomb-Rice coding for compression. This
document specifies one initial filter type based on this construction
that enables basic wallets and applications with more advanced smart
contracts.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p><a href="https://bips.dev/158/bip-0157.mediawiki" title="wikilink">BIP 157</a> defines a light client protocol
based on deterministic filters of block content. The filters are
designed to minimize the expected bandwidth consumed by light clients,
downloading filters and full blocks. This document defines the initial
filter type <em>basic</em> that is designed to reduce the filter size for
regular wallets.</p>

<h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>
<h3 id="golomb-coded-sets">Golomb-Coded Sets</h3>
<p>For each block, compact filters are derived containing sets of items
associated with the block (eg. addresses sent to, outpoints spent,
etc.). A set of such data objects is compressed into a probabilistic
structure called a <em>Golomb-coded set</em> (GCS), which matches all items in
the set with probability 1, and matches other items with probability
<code>1/M</code> for some integer parameter <code>M</code>. The encoding is also parameterized
by <code>P</code>, the bit length of the remainder code. Each filter defined
specifies values for <code>P</code> and <code>M</code>.</p>
<p>At a high level, a GCS is constructed from a set of <code>N</code> items by:</p>
<ol>
<li>hashing all items to 64-bit integers in the range <code>[0, N * M)</code></li>
<li>sorting the hashed values in ascending order</li>
<li>computing the differences between each value and the previous one</li>
<li>writing the differences sequentially, compressed with Golomb-Rice
coding</li>
</ol>
<p>The following sections describe each step in greater detail.</p>
<h4 id="hashing-data-objects">Hashing Data Objects</h4>
<p>The first step in the filter construction is hashing the variable-sized
raw items in the set to the range <code>[0, F)</code>, where <code>F = N *</code> <code>M</code>.
Customarily, <code>M</code> is set to <code>2^P</code>. However, if one is able to select both
Parameters independently, then more optimal values can be selected[2].
Set membership queries against the hash outputs will have a false
positive rate of <code>M</code>. To avoid integer overflow, the number of items <code>N</code>
MUST be &lt;2^32 and <code>M</code> MUST be &lt;2^32.</p>
<p>The items are first passed through the pseudorandom function <em>SipHash</em>,
which takes a 128-bit key <code>k</code> and a variable-sized byte vector and
produces a uniformly random 64-bit output. Implementations of this BIP
MUST use the SipHash parameters <code>c = 2</code> and <code>d = 4</code>.</p>
<p>The 64-bit SipHash outputs are then mapped uniformly over the desired
range by multiplying with F and taking the top 64 bits of the 128-bit
result. This algorithm is a faster alternative to modulo reduction, as
it avoids the expensive division operation[3]. Note that care must be
taken when implementing this reduction to ensure the upper 64 bits of
the integer multiplication are not truncated; certain architectures and
high level languages may require code that decomposes the 64-bit
multiplication into four 32-bit multiplications and recombines into the
result.</p>
<pre style="background-color:#fafafa;">
<code>hash_to_range(item: []byte, F: uint64, k: [16]byte) -&gt; uint64:
    return (siphash(k, item) * F) &gt;&gt; 64

hashed_set_construct(raw_items: [][]byte, k: [16]byte, M: uint) -&gt; []uint64:
    let N = len(raw_items)
    let F = N * M

    let set_items = []

    for item in raw_items:
        let set_value = hash_to_range(item, F, k)
        set_items.append(set_value)

    return set_items
</code></pre><h4 id="golomb-rice-coding">Golomb-Rice Coding</h4>
<p>Instead of writing the items in the hashed set directly to the filter,
greater compression is achieved by only writing the differences between
successive items in sorted order. Since the items are distributed
uniformly, it can be shown that the differences resemble a geometric
distribution[4]. <em>Golomb-Rice</em> <em>coding</em>[5] is a technique that
optimally compresses geometrically distributed values.</p>
<p>With Golomb-Rice, a value is split into a quotient and remainder modulo
<code>2^P</code>, which are encoded separately. The quotient <code>q</code> is encoded as
<em>unary</em>, with a string of <code>q</code> 1's followed by one 0. The remainder <code>r</code>
is represented in big-endian by P bits. For example, this is a table of
Golomb-Rice coded values using <code>P=2</code>:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>n</th><th>(q, r)</th><th>c</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>0</td><td>(0, 0)</td><td><code>0 00</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>(0, 1)</td><td><code>0 01</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>(0, 2)</td><td><code>0 10</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>(0, 3)</td><td><code>0 11</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>(1, 0)</td><td><code>10 00</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>(1, 1)</td><td><code>10 01</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>(1, 2)</td><td><code>10 10</code></td></tr>

</code></pre><h4 id="set-construction">Set Construction</h4>
<p>A GCS is constructed from four parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>L</code>, a vector of <code>N</code> raw items</li>
<li><code>P</code>, the bit parameter of the Golomb-Rice coding</li>
<li><code>M</code>, the target false positive rate</li>
<li><code>k</code>, the 128-bit key used to randomize the SipHash outputs</li>
</ul>
<p>The result is a byte vector with a minimum size of <code>N * (P + 1)</code> bits.</p>
<p>The raw items in <code>L</code> are first hashed to 64-bit unsigned integers as
specified above and sorted. The differences between consecutive values,
hereafter referred to as <em>deltas</em>, are encoded sequentially to a bit
stream with Golomb-Rice coding. Finally, the bit stream is padded with
0's to the nearest byte boundary and serialized to the output byte
vector.</p>
<pre style="background-color:#fafafa;">
<code>construct_gcs(L: [][]byte, P: uint, k: [16]byte, M: uint) -&gt; []byte:
    let set_items = hashed_set_construct(L, k, M)

    set_items.sort()

    let output_stream = new_bit_stream()

    let last_value = 0
    for item in set_items:
        let delta = item - last_value
        golomb_encode(output_stream, delta, P)
        last_value = item

    return output_stream.bytes()
</code></pre><h4 id="set-querying-decompression">Set Querying/Decompression</h4>
<p>To check membership of an item in a compressed GCS, one must reconstruct
the hashed set members from the encoded deltas. The procedure to do so
is the reverse of the compression: deltas are decoded one by one and
added to a cumulative sum. Each intermediate sum represents a hashed
value in the original set. The queried item is hashed in the same way as
the set members and compared against the reconstructed values. Note that
querying does not require the entire decompressed set be held in memory
at once.</p>
<pre style="background-color:#fafafa;">
<code>gcs_match(key: [16]byte, compressed_set: []byte, target: []byte, P: uint, N: uint, M: uint) -&gt; bool:
    let F = N * M
    let target_hash = hash_to_range(target, F, k)

    stream = new_bit_stream(compressed_set)

    let last_value = 0

    loop N times:
        let delta = golomb_decode(stream, P)
        let set_item = last_value + delta

        if set_item == target_hash:
            return true

        // Since the values in the set are sorted, terminate the search once
        // the decoded value exceeds the target.
        if set_item &gt; target_hash:
            break

        last_value = set_item

    return false
</code></pre>
<p>Some applications may need to check for set intersection instead of
membership of a single item. This can be performed far more efficiently
than checking each item individually by leveraging the sorted structure
of the compressed GCS. First the query elements are all hashed and
sorted, then compared in order against the decompressed GCS contents.

<h3 id="block-filters">Block Filters</h3>
<p>This BIP defines one initial filter type:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic (<code>0x00</code>)
<ul>
<li><code>M = 784931</code></li>
<li><code>P = 19</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="contents">Contents</h4>
<p>The basic filter is designed to contain everything that a light client
needs to sync a regular Bitcoin wallet. A basic filter MUST contain
exactly the following items for each transaction in a block:</p>
<ul>
<li>The previous output script (the script being spent) for each input,
except</li>
</ul>
<p><code> for the coinbase transaction.</code></p>
<ul>
<li>The scriptPubKey of each output, aside from all <code>OP_RETURN</code> output</li>
</ul>
<p><code> scripts.</code></p>
<p>Any &quot;nil&quot; items MUST NOT be included into the final set of filter
elements.</p>
<p>We exclude all outputs that start with <code>OP_RETURN</code> in order to allow
filters to easily be committed to in the future via a soft-fork. A
likely area for future commitments is an additional <code>OP_RETURN</code> output
in the coinbase transaction similar to the current witness commitment
[6]. By excluding all <code>OP_RETURN</code> outputs we avoid a circular
dependency between the commitment, and the item being committed to.</p>
<h4 id="construction">Construction</h4>
<p>The basic type is constructed as Golomb-coded sets with the following
parameters.</p>
<p>The parameter <code>P</code> MUST be set to <code>19</code>, and the parameter <code>M</code> MUST be set
to <code>784931</code>. Analysis has shown that if one is able to select <code>P</code> and
<code>M</code> independently, then setting <code>M=1.497137 * 2^P</code> is close to optimal
[7].</p>
<p>Empirical analysis also shows that was chosen as these parameters
minimize the bandwidth utilized, considering both the expected number of
blocks downloaded due to false positives and the size of the filters
themselves.</p>
<p>The parameter <code>k</code> MUST be set to the first 16 bytes of the hash (in
standard little-endian representation) of the block for which the filter
is constructed. This ensures the key is deterministic while still
varying from block to block.</p>
<p>Since the value <code>N</code> is required to decode a GCS, a serialized GCS
includes it as a prefix, written as a <code>CompactSize</code>. Thus, the complete
serialization of a filter is:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>N</code>, encoded as a <code>CompactSize</code></li>
<li>The bytes of the compressed filter itself</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="signaling">Signaling</h4>

<tr><td>NODE_COMPACT_FILTERS</td><td><code>1 &lt;&lt; 6</code></td><td>If enabled, the node MUST respond to all BIP 157 messages for filter type <code>0x00</code></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<h2 id="compatibility">Compatibility</h2>
<p>This block filter construction is not incompatible with existing
software, though it requires implementation of the new filters.</p>

<h2 id="appendix-a-alternatives">Appendix A: Alternatives</h2>
<p>A number of alternative set encodings were considered before
Golomb-coded sets were settled upon. In this appendix section, we'll
list a few of the alternatives along with our rationale for not pursuing
them.</p>
<h4 id="bloom-filters">Bloom Filters</h4>
<p>Bloom Filters are perhaps the best known probabilistic data structure
for testing set membership, and were introduced into the Bitcoin
protocol with BIP 37. The size of a Bloom filter is larger than the
expected size of a GCS with the same false positive rate, which is the
main reason the option was rejected.</p>
<h4 id="cryptographic-accumulators">Cryptographic Accumulators</h4>
<p>Cryptographic accumulators[8] are a cryptographic data structures that
enable (amongst other operations) a one way membership test. One
advantage of accumulators are that they are constant size, independent
of the number of elements inserted into the accumulator. However,
current constructions of cryptographic accumulators require an initial
trusted set up. Additionally, accumulators based on the Strong-RSA
Assumption require mapping set items to prime representatives in the
associated group which can be preemptively expensive.</p>
<h4 id="matrix-based-probabilistic-set-data-structures">Matrix Based Probabilistic Set Data Structures</h4>
<p>There exist data structures based on matrix solving which are even more
space efficient compared to Bloom filters[9]. We instead opted for our
GCS-based filters as they have a much lower implementation complexity
and are easier to understand.</p>
