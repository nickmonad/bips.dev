  Title: WTXID-based transaction relay

</span></code></pre><h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This BIP describes two changes to the p2p protocol to support
transaction relay based on the BIP 141 wtxid of a transaction, rather
than its txid.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Historically, the inv messages sent on the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network
to announce transactions refer to transactions by their txid, which is a
hash of the transaction that does not include the witness (see BIP 141).
This has been the case even since Segregated Witness (BIP 141/143/144)
has been adopted by the network.</p>
<p>Not committing to the witness in transaction announcements creates
inefficiencies: because a transaction's witness can be malleated without
altering the txid, a node in receipt of a witness transaction that the
node does not accept will generally still download that same transaction
when announced by other peers. This is because the alternative -- of not
downloading a given txid after rejecting a transaction with that txid --
would allow a third party to interfere with transaction relay by
malleating a transaction's witness and announcing the resulting invalid
transaction to nodes, preventing relay of the valid version of the
transaction as well.</p>
<p>We can eliminate this concern by using the wtxid in place of the txid
when announcing and fetching transactions.</p>
<h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>
<ol>
<li>A new wtxidrelay message is added, which is defined as an empty
message where pchCommand == &quot;wtxidrelay&quot;.</li>
<li>The protocol version of nodes implementing this BIP must be set to
70016 or higher.</li>
<li>The wtxidrelay message MUST be sent in response to a version message
from a peer whose protocol version is &gt;= 70016 and prior to sending
a verack. A wtxidrelay message received after a verack message MUST
be ignored or treated as invalid.</li>
<li>A new inv type MSG_WTX (0x00000005) is added, for use in both inv
messages and getdata requests, indicating that the hash being
referenced is a transaction's wtxid. In the case of getdata
requests, MSG_WTX implies that the transaction being requested
should be serialized with witness as well, as described in BIP 144.</li>
<li>After a node has received a wtxidrelay message from a peer, the node
MUST use the MSG_WTX inv type when announcing transactions to that
peer.</li>
<li>After a node has received a wtxidrelay message from a peer, the node
SHOULD use a MSG_WTX getdata message to request any announced
transactions. A node MAY still request transactions from that peer
using MSG_TX getdata messages, such as for transactions not
recently announced by that peer (like the parents of recently
announced transactions).</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="backward-compatibility">Backward compatibility</h2>
<p>As wtxid-based transaction relay is only enabled between peers that both
support it, older clients remain fully compatible and interoperable
after this change.</p>
