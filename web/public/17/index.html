<p>This BIP describes a new opcode (OP_CHECKHASHVERIFY) for the Bitcoin
scripting system, and a new 'standard' transaction type that uses it to
enables the receiver of bitcoins to specify the transaction type needed
to re-spend them.</p>
<h2 id="copyright">Copyright</h2>
<p>This BIP is licensed under the BSD 2-clause license.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>The purpose of pay-to-script-hash is to move the responsibility for
supplying the conditions to redeem a transaction from the sender of the
funds to the redeemer.</p>
<p>The benefit is allowing a sender to fund any arbitrary transaction, no
matter how complicated, using a fixed-length 20-byte hash that is short
enough to scan from a QR code or easily copied and pasted.</p>
<h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>
<p>OP_CHECKHASHVERIFY will re-define the existing OP_NOP2 opcode, and
will function as follows when executed:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, hash the end of the prior script (in the general case,
scriptSig; if no prior script, a null string is hashed) beginning
from the last evaluated OP_CODESEPARATOR onward (or from the
beginning of the script, if no OP_CODESEPARATOR was present)</li>
<li>Then, compare this with the item on the top of the stack (if there
is none, the script fails immediately)</li>
<li>If the hashes match, do nothing, proceed as if an OP_NOP; if they
do not match, the script fails immediately.</li>
<li>Note that in the case of a matched hash, the top stack item (the
hash being compared with) is <u>not</u> popped off the stack. This
is for backward compatibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>This opcode reassignment shall be applied when validating transactions
in blocks only with timestamps after February 23, 2012 (see the
Backwards Compatibility section for details).</p>
<p>A new standard transaction type that is relayed and included in mined
blocks is defined:</p>
<p><code>   [20-byte-hash-value] OP_CHECKHASHVERIFY OP_DROP</code></p>
<p>[20-byte-hash-value] shall be the push-20-bytes-onto-the-stack opcode
(0x14) followed by exactly 20 bytes.</p>
<p>This new transaction type is redeemed by a standard scriptSig:</p>
<p><code>   ...signatures... OP_CODESEPARATOR {script}</code></p>
<p>Transactions that redeem these pay-to-script outpoints are only
considered standard if they contain exactly one OP_CODESEPARATOR and
the appended <em>script</em> is, itself, one of the other standard transaction
types.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>For example, the scriptPubKey and corresponding scriptSig for a
one-signature-required transaction is:</p>
<p><code>   scriptSig: [signature] OP_CODESEPARATOR [pubkey] OP_CHECKSIG</code><br />
<code>   scriptPubKey: [20-byte-hash of {[pubkey] OP_CHECKSIG} ] OP_CHECKHASHVERIFY OP_DROP</code></p>
<p>2-of-3:</p>
<p><code>   scriptSig: [signatures...] OP_CODESEPARATOR 2 [pubkey1] [pubkey2] [pubkey3] 3 OP_CHECKMULTISIG</code><br />
<code>   scriptPubKey: [20-byte-hash of {2 [pubkey1] [pubkey2] [pubkey3] 3 OP_CHECKMULTISIG} ] OP_CHECKHASHVERIFY OP_DROP</code></p>
<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>This BIP replaces BIP 12 and BIP 16, which propose evaluating a Script
from the stack after verifying its hash.</p>
<p>The Motivation for this BIP (and BIP 13, the pay-to-script-hash address
type) is somewhat controversial; several people feel that it is
unnecessary, and complex/multisignature transaction types should be
supported by simply giving the sender the complete {serialized script}.
The author believes that this BIP will minimize the changes needed to
all of the supporting infrastructure that has already been created to
send funds to a base58-encoded-20-byte bitcoin addresses, allowing
merchants and exchanges and other software to start supporting
multisignature transactions sooner.</p>
<p>There is a 1-confirmation attack on old implementations, but it is
expensive and difficult in practice. The attack is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Attacker creates a pay-to-script-hash transaction that is valid as
seen by old software, but invalid for new implementation, and sends
themselves some coins using it.</li>
<li>Attacker also creates a standard transaction that spends the
pay-to-script transaction, and pays the victim who is running old
software.</li>
<li>Attacker mines a block that contains both transactions.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the victim accepts the 1-confirmation payment, then the attacker wins
because both transactions will be invalidated when the rest of the
network overwrites the attacker's invalid block.</p>
<p>The attack is expensive because it requires the attacker create a block
that they know will be invalidated by the rest of the network. It is
difficult because creating blocks is difficult and users should not
accept 1-confirmation transactions for higher-value transactions.</p>
<h2 id="backwards-compatibility">Backwards Compatibility</h2>
<p>These transactions are non-standard to old implementations, which will
(typically) not relay them nor include them in blocks.</p>
<p>Old implementations will not validate that the {script}'s hash value
matches when they validate blocks created by software that fully support
this BIP.</p>
<p>Avoiding a block-chain split by malicious pay-to-script transactions
requires careful handling of one case:</p>
<ul>
<li>A pay-to-script-hash transaction that is invalid for new
clients/miners but valid for old clients/miners.</li>
</ul>
<p>To gracefully upgrade and ensure no long-lasting block-chain split
occurs, more than 50% of miners must support full validation of the new
transaction type and must switch from the old validation rules to the
new rules at the same time.</p>
<p>To judge whether or not more than 50% of hashing power supports this
BIP, miners are asked to upgrade their software and put the string
&quot;p2sh/CHV&quot; in the input of the coinbase transaction for blocks that they
create.</p>
<p>On February 8, 2012, the block-chain will be examined to determine the
number of blocks supporting pay-to-script-hash for the previous 7 days.
If at least 60% contain &quot;p2sh/CHV&quot; in their coinbase, then all blocks
with timestamps after 23 Feb 2012, 00:00:00 GMT shall have their
pay-to-script-hash transactions validated.</p>
<p>If a majority of hashing power does not support the new validation
rules, then rollout will be postponed (or rejected if it becomes clear
that a majority will never be achieved).</p>
<p>OP_NOP2 is used, so existing OP_EVAL (BIP 12) transactions in the
block chain can still be redeemed.</p>
