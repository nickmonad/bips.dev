<p>Compact blocks on the wire as a way to save bandwidth for nodes on the
P2P network.</p>
<p>The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
&quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Historically, the Bitcoin P2P protocol has not been very bandwidth
efficient for block relay. Every transaction in a block is included when
relayed, even though a large number of the transactions in a given block
are already available to nodes before the block is relayed. This causes
moderate inbound bandwidth spikes for nodes when receiving blocks, but
can cause very significant outbound bandwidth spikes for some nodes
which receive a block before their peers. When such spikes occur, buffer
bloat can make consumer-grade internet connections temporarily unusable,
and can delay the relay of blocks to remote peers who may choose to wait
instead of redundantly requesting the same block from other, less
congested, peers.</p>
<p>Thus, decreasing the bandwidth used during block relay is very useful
for many individuals running nodes.</p>
<p>While the goal of this work is explicitly not to reduce block transfer
latency, it does, as a side effect reduce block transfer latencies in
some rather significant ways. Additionally, this work forms a foundation
for future work explicitly targeting low-latency block transfer.</p>
<h2 id="specification-for-version-1">Specification for version 1</h2>
<h3 id="intended-protocol-flow">Intended Protocol Flow</h3>
<p><img src=bip-0152/protocol-flow.png></img></p>
<p>The protocol is intended to be used in two ways, depending on the peers
and bandwidth available, as discussed
<a href="https://bips.dev/152/#Implementation_Notes" title="wikilink">later</a>. The &quot;high-bandwidth&quot; mode,
which nodes may only enable for a few of their peers, is enabled by
setting the first boolean to 1 in a <code>sendcmpct</code> message. In this mode,
peers send new block announcements with the short transaction IDs
already (via a <code>cmpctblock</code> message), possibly even before fully
validating the block (as indicated by the grey box in the image above).
In some cases no further round-trip is needed, and the receiver can
reconstruct the block and process it as usual immediately. When some
transactions were not available from local sources (ie mempool), a
<code>getblocktxn</code>/<code>blocktxn</code> roundtrip is necessary, bringing the best-case
latency to the same 1.5*RTT minimum time that nodes take today, though
with significantly less bandwidth usage.</p>
<p>The &quot;low-bandwidth&quot; mode is enabled by setting the first boolean to 0 in
a <code>sendcmpct</code> message. In this mode, peers send new block announcements
with the usual inv/headers announcements (as per BIP130, and after fully
validating the block). The receiving peer may then request the block
using a MSG_CMPCT_BLOCK <code>getdata</code> request, which will receive a
response of the header and short transaction IDs. In some cases no
further round-trip is needed, and the receiver can reconstruct the block
and process it as usual, taking the same 1.5*RTT minimum time that
nodes take today, though with significantly less bandwidth usage. When
some transactions were not available from local sources (ie mempool), a
<code>getblocktxn</code>/<code>blocktxn</code> roundtrip is necessary, bringing the latency to
at least 2.5*RTT in this case, again with significantly less bandwidth
usage than today. Because TCP often exhibits worse transfer latency for
larger data sizes (as a multiple of RTT), total latency is expected to
be reduced even when the full 2.5*RTT transfer mechanism is used.</p>
<h3 id="new-data-structures">New data structures</h3>
<p>Several new data structures are added to the P2P network to relay
compact blocks: PrefilledTransaction, HeaderAndShortIDs,
BlockTransactionsRequest, and BlockTransactions.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this section, CompactSize refers to the
variable-length integer encoding used across the existing P2P protocol
to encode array lengths, among other things, in 1, 3, 5 or 9 bytes. Only
CompactSize encodings which are minimally-encoded (ie the shortest
length possible) are used by this spec. Any other CompactSize encodings
are left with undefined behavior.</p>
<p>Several uses of CompactSize below are &quot;differentially encoded&quot;. For
these, instead of using raw indexes, the number encoded is the
difference between the current index and the previous index, minus one.
For example, a first index of 0 implies a real index of 0, a second
index of 0 thereafter refers to a real index of 1, etc.</p>
<h4 id="prefilledtransaction">PrefilledTransaction</h4>
<p>A PrefilledTransaction structure is used in HeaderAndShortIDs to provide
a list of a few transactions explicitly.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Field Name</td><td>Type</td><td>Size</td><td>Encoding</td><td>Purpose</td></tr>
<tr><td>index</td><td>CompactSize</td><td>1, 3 bytes</td><td>Compact Size, differentially encoded since the last PrefilledTransaction in a list</td><td>The index into the block at which this transaction is</td></tr>
<tr><td>tx</td><td>Transaction</td><td>variable</td><td>As encoded in &quot;tx&quot; messages sent in response to getdata MSG_TX</td><td>The transaction which is in the block at index index.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<h4 id="headerandshortids">HeaderAndShortIDs</h4>
<p>A HeaderAndShortIDs structure is used to relay a block header, the short
transactions IDs used for matching already-available transactions, and a
select few transactions which we expect a peer may be missing.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Field Name</td><td>Type</td><td>Size</td><td>Encoding</td><td>Purpose</td></tr>
<tr><td>header</td><td>Block header</td><td>80 bytes</td><td>First 80 bytes of the block as defined by the encoding used by &quot;block&quot; messages</td><td>The header of the block being provided</td></tr>

<tr><td>shortids_length</td><td>CompactSize</td><td>1 or 3 bytes</td><td>As used to encode array lengths elsewhere</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>shortids</td><td>List of 6-byte integers</td><td>6*shortids_length bytes</td><td>Little Endian</td><td>The short transaction IDs calculated from the transactions which were not provided explicitly in prefilledtxn</td></tr>

<tr><td>prefilledtxn</td><td>List of PrefilledTransactions</td><td>variable size*prefilledtxn_length</td><td>As defined by PrefilledTransaction definition, above</td><td>Used to provide the coinbase transaction and a select few which we expect a peer may be missing</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<h4 id="blocktransactionsrequest">BlockTransactionsRequest</h4>
<p>A BlockTransactionsRequest structure is used to list transaction indexes
in a block being requested.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Field Name</td><td>Type</td><td>Size</td><td>Encoding</td><td>Purpose</td></tr>
<tr><td>blockhash</td><td>Binary blob</td><td>32 bytes</td><td>The output from a double-SHA256 of the block header, as used elsewhere</td><td>The blockhash of the block which the transactions being requested are in</td></tr>

<tr><td>indexes</td><td>List of CompactSizes</td><td>1 or 3 bytes*indexes_length</td><td>Differentially encoded</td><td>The indexes of the transactions being requested in the block</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<h4 id="blocktransactions">BlockTransactions</h4>
<p>A BlockTransactions structure is used to provide some of the
transactions in a block, as requested.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Field Name</td><td>Type</td><td>Size</td><td>Encoding</td><td>Purpose</td></tr>
<tr><td>blockhash</td><td>Binary blob</td><td>32 bytes</td><td>The output from a double-SHA256 of the block header, as used elsewhere</td><td>The blockhash of the block which the transactions being provided are in</td></tr>

<tr><td>transactions</td><td>List of Transactions</td><td>variable</td><td>As encoded in &quot;tx&quot; messages in response to getdata MSG_TX</td><td>The transactions provided</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<h4 id="short-transaction-ids">Short transaction IDs</h4>
<p>Short transaction IDs are used to represent a transaction without
sending a full 256-bit hash. They are calculated by:</p>
<ol>
<li>single-SHA256 hashing the block header with the nonce appended (in
little-endian)</li>
<li>Running SipHash-2-4 with the input being the transaction ID and the
keys (k0/k1) set to the first two little-endian 64-bit integers from
the above hash, respectively.</li>
<li>Dropping the 2 most significant bytes from the SipHash output to
make it 6 bytes.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="new-messages">New messages</h3>
<p>A new inv type (MSG_CMPCT_BLOCK == 4) and several new protocol
messages are added: sendcmpct, cmpctblock, getblocktxn, and blocktxn.</p>
<h4 id="sendcmpct">sendcmpct</h4>
<ol>
<li>The sendcmpct message is defined as a message containing a 1-byte
integer followed by a 8-byte integer where pchCommand ==
&quot;sendcmpct&quot;.</li>
<li>The first integer SHALL be interpreted as a boolean (and MUST have a
value of either 1 or 0)</li>
<li>The second integer SHALL be interpreted as a little-endian version
number. Nodes sending a sendcmpct message MUST currently set this
value to 1.</li>
<li>Upon receipt of a &quot;sendcmpct&quot; message with the first and second
integers set to 1, the node SHOULD announce new blocks by sending a
cmpctblock message.</li>
<li>Upon receipt of a &quot;sendcmpct&quot; message with the first integer set to
0, the node SHOULD NOT announce new blocks by sending a cmpctblock
message, but SHOULD announce new blocks by sending invs or headers,
as defined by BIP130.</li>
<li>Upon receipt of a &quot;sendcmpct&quot; message with the second integer set to
something other than 1, nodes MUST treat the peer as if they had not
received the message (as it indicates the peer will provide an
unexpected encoding in cmpctblock, and/or other, messages). This
allows future versions to send duplicate sendcmpct messages with
different versions as a part of a version handshake for future
versions. See Protocol Versioning section, below, for more info on
the specifics of the version-negotiation mechanics.</li>
<li>Nodes SHOULD check for a protocol version of &gt;= 70014 before
sending sendcmpct messages.</li>
<li>Nodes MUST NOT send a request for a MSG_CMPCT_BLOCK object to a
peer before having received a sendcmpct message from that peer.</li>
<li>Nodes MUST NOT request a MSG_CMPCT_BLOCK object before having sent
all sendcmpct messages to that peer which they intend to send, as
the peer cannot know what version protocol to use in the response.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="msg-cmpct-block">MSG_CMPCT_BLOCK</h4>
<ol>
<li>getdata messages may now contain requests for MSG_CMPCT_BLOCK
objects.</li>
<li>Upon receipt of a getdata containing a request for a
MSG_CMPCT_BLOCK object with the hash of a block which was recently
announced and is close to the tip of the best chain of the receiver
and after having sent the requesting peer a sendcmpct message, nodes
MUST respond with a cmpctblock message containing appropriate data
representing the block being requested.</li>
<li>Upon receipt of a getdata containing a request for a
MSG_CMPCT_BLOCK object for which a cmpctblock message is not sent
in response, a block message containing the requested block in
non-compact form MUST be sent.</li>
<li>MSG_CMPCT_BLOCK inv objects MUST NOT appear anywhere except for in
getdata messages.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="cmpctblock">cmpctblock</h4>
<ol>
<li>The cmpctblock message is defined as a message containing a
serialized HeaderAndShortIDs message and pchCommand == &quot;cmpctblock&quot;.</li>
<li>Upon receipt of a cmpctblock message after sending a sendcmpct
message, nodes SHOULD calculate the short transaction ID for each
unconfirmed transaction they have available (ie in their mempool)
and compare each to each short transaction ID in the cmpctblock
message.</li>
<li>After finding already-available transactions, nodes which do not
have all transactions available to reconstruct the full block SHOULD
request the missing transactions using a getblocktxn message.</li>
<li>A node MUST NOT send a cmpctblock message unless they are able to
respond to a getblocktxn message which requests every transaction in
the block.</li>
<li>A node MUST NOT send a cmpctblock message without having validated
that the header properly commits to each transaction in the block,
and properly builds on top of the existing, fully-validated chain
with a valid proof-of-work either as a part of the current most-work
valid chain, or building directly on top of it. A node MAY send a
cmpctblock before validating that each transaction in the block
validly spends existing UTXO set entries.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="getblocktxn">getblocktxn</h4>
<ol>
<li>The getblocktxn message is defined as a message containing a
serialized BlockTransactionsRequest message and pchCommand ==
&quot;getblocktxn&quot;.</li>
<li>Upon receipt of a properly-formatted getblocktxn message, nodes
which recently provided the sender of such a message a cmpctblock
for the block hash identified in this message MUST respond with
either an appropriate blocktxn message, or a full block message. A
blocktxn response MUST contain exactly and only each transaction
which is present in the appropriate block at the index specified in
the getblocktxn indexes list, in the order requested.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="blocktxn">blocktxn</h4>
<ol>
<li>The blocktxn message is defined as a message containing a serialized
BlockTransactions message and pchCommand == &quot;blocktxn&quot;.</li>
<li>Upon receipt of a properly-formatted requested blocktxn message,
nodes SHOULD attempt to reconstruct the full block by:
<ol>
<li>Taking the prefilledtxn transactions from the original
cmpctblock and placing them in the marked positions.</li>
<li>For each short transaction ID from the original cmpctblock, in
order, find the corresponding transaction either from the
blocktxn message or from other sources and place it in the first
available position in the block.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Once the block has been reconstructed, it shall be processed as
normal, keeping in mind that short transaction IDs are expected to
occasionally collide, and that nodes MUST NOT be penalized for such
collisions, wherever they appear.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="protocol-versioning">Protocol Versioning</h2>
<ol>
<li>The protocol version negotiation allows two nodes to agree on the
versions of compact blocks which they will exchange. As it is only
in a single field, it does not allow a node to support a specific
version in only one direction (sending or receiving).</li>
<li>Upon connection establishment, a node SHOULD send a burst of
sendcmpct messages containing every version of compact block
encodings for which they are willing to support sending cmpctblock
and blocktxn messages, and receiving getblocktxn messages. These
messages SHOULD be ordered in the order of the priority which the
node wishes to receive cmpctblock/blocktxn messages, with the
highest-priority version sendcmpct message sent first.</li>
<li>The encoding version used to send a cmpctblock or blocktxn message
or to receive a getblocktxn message MUST be the second integer
(version number) in the first sendcmpct message received for which a
sendcmpct message with the same version number was sent.</li>
<li>Nodes MUST NOT send a sendcmpct message which contains a version
number other than the version number which has been negotiated for
receiving cmpctblock/blocktxn messages after sending a request for a
MSG_CMPCT_BLOCK object, sending a cmpctblock, getblocktxn,
blocktxn, or pong message.</li>
<li>As a node must send all sendcmpct messages which contain a novel
version announcement before any other compact block-related
messages, it is possible to determine which version of compact
blocks will be used for each object received. It is, however, not
possible to know which version will be used to encode the response
to a request for a compact block object before any
MSG_CMPCT_BLOCK-containing getdata, cmpctblock, getblocktxn,
blocktxn, or ping/pong messages have been exchanged.</li>
<li>Thus, if a node wishes to determine exactly which version of compact
blocks will be used before requesting a compact block object, it
must send all of its sendcmpct version announcements, followed by a
ping, and wait for the pong response to ensure it has received all
sendcmpctblock version announcement messages from the remote peer.
Nodes can, obviously, however, determine that the version used will
be at least a certain version (in their priority order) after having
received a sendcmpct message from the remote peer containing that
version as the second integer.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="sample-version-implementation">Sample Version Implementation</h3>
<ol>
<li>By way of example, an implementation of the above protocol might
look like the following.</li>
<li>Upon exchanging version/verack messages, a node immediately sends
its list of sendcmpct announcements to the other side, with the
version which it wants to receive sent first.</li>
<li>Upon receiving the first sendcmpct announcement with a protocol
version which is understood from the remote peer, a node will &quot;lock
in&quot; the compact block encoding version which will be used to encode
compact blocks to that peer.</li>
<li>The node then sets the current receive-protocol-version in use on
the connection to that version, and uses it to decode new compact
block messages.</li>
<li>Upon receiving subsequent sendcmpct announcements with a protocol
version which is understood from the remote peer (ie a version which
has been announced using a sendcmpct in the other direction), a node
will check if that protocol version is higher-receive-priority than
the current receive-protocol-version in use on the connection, and
switch to that version for decoding new compact block messages
received.</li>
<li>A node might wish to keep a flag for each peer which indicates
compact block version negotiation is complete, which can be set upon
receiving any compact block-related, or pong message.</li>
<li>The above implementation requires only a compile-time list of
supported versions in some static priority order, two version fields
per peer, and an optional negotiation-complete boolean per-peer.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="specification-for-version-2">Specification for version 2</h2>
<p>Compact blocks version 2 is almost identical to version 1, but supports
segregated witness transactions (BIP 141 and BIP 144). The changes are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The second integer (version number) inside sendcmpct is 2 instead of
1 (see Protocol Versioning section, above).</li>
<li>Transactions inside cmpctblock messages (both those used as direct
announcement and those in response to getdata) and in blocktxn
should include witness data, using the same format as responses to
getdata MSG_WITNESS_TX, specified in BIP144.</li>
<li>Short transaction IDs sent to us in cmpctblock messages, and sent by
us in getblocktxn messages, are computed using the same process as
in version 1, but using the wtxid as defined in BIP 141 instead of
the txid. Note that, though a node normally SHOULD, if a node does
not include (ie must then include the short ID for) the coinbase
transaction, it must be computed by encoding the transaction in
witness format as defined by BIP 141.</li>
<li>Upon receipt of a getdata containing a request for a
MSG_CMPCT_BLOCK object for which a cmpctblock message is not sent
in response, the block message containing the requested block in
non-compact form MUST be encoded with witnesses (as is sent in reply
to a MSG_WITNESS_BLOCK getdata) if the protocol version used to
encode the cmpctblock message would have been 2, and encoded without
witnesses (as is sent in response to a MSG_BLOCK getdata) if the
protocol version used to encode the cmpctblock message would have
been 1.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="implementation-notes">Implementation Notes</h2>
<ol>
<li>For nodes which have sufficient inbound bandwidth, sending a
sendcmpct message with the first integer set to 1 to up to 3 peers
is RECOMMENDED. If possible, it is RECOMMENDED that those peers be
selected based on their past performance in providing blocks quickly
(eg the three peers which provided the highest number of the recent
N blocks the quickest), allowing nodes to receive blocks which come
from those peers in only 0.5*RTT.</li>
</ol>
<!-- end list -->
<ol>
<li>Nodes MUST NOT send such sendcmpct messages to more than three
peers, as it encourages wasting outbound bandwidth across the
network.</li>
</ol>
<!-- end list -->
<ol>
<li>All nodes SHOULD send a sendcmpct message to all appropriate peers.
This will reduce their outbound bandwidth usage by allowing their
peers to request compact blocks instead of full blocks.</li>
</ol>
<!-- end list -->
<ol>
<li>Nodes with limited inbound bandwidth SHOULD request blocks using
MSG_CMPCT_BLOCK/getblocktxn requests, when possible. While this
increases worst-case message round-trips, it is expected to reduce
overall transfer latency as TCP is more likely to exhibit poor
throughput on low-bandwidth nodes.</li>
</ol>
<!-- end list -->
<ol>
<li>Nodes sending cmpctblock messages SHOULD limit prefilledtxn to 10KB
of transactions. When in doubt, nodes SHOULD only include the
coinbase transaction in prefilledtxn.</li>
</ol>
<!-- end list -->
<ol>
<li>Nodes MAY pick one nonce per block they wish to send, and only build
a cmpctblock message once for all peers which they wish to send a
given block to. Nodes SHOULD NOT use the same nonce across multiple
different blocks.</li>
</ol>
<!-- end list -->
<ol>
<li>Nodes MAY impose additional requirements on when they announce new
blocks by sending cmpctblock messages. For example, nodes with
limited outbound bandwidth MAY choose to announce new blocks using
inv/header messages (as per BIP130) to conserve outbound bandwidth.</li>
</ol>
<!-- end list -->
<ol>
<li>Note that the MSG_CMPCT_BLOCK section does not require that nodes
respond to MSG_CMPCT_BLOCK getdata requests for blocks which they
did not recently announce. This allows nodes to calculate cmpctblock
messages at announce-time instead of at request-time. Blocks which
are requested with a MSG_CMPCT_BLOCK getdata, but which are not
responded to with a cmpctblock message MUST be responded to with a
block message, allowing nodes to request all blocks using
MSG_CMPCT_BLOCK getdatas and rely on their peer to pick an
appropriate response.</li>
</ol>
<!-- end list -->
<ol>
<li>While the current version sends transactions with the same encodings
as are used in tx messages and elsewhere in the protocol, the
version field in sendcmpct is intended to allow this to change in
the future. For this reason, it is recommended that the code used to
decode PrefilledTransaction and BlockTransactions messages be
prepared to take a different transaction encoding, if and when the
version field in sendcmpct changes in a future BIP.</li>
</ol>
<!-- end list -->
<ol>
<li>Any undefined behavior in this spec may cause failure to transfer
block to, peer disconnection by, or self-destruction by the
receiving node. A node receiving non-minimally-encoded CompactSize
encodings should make a best-effort to eat the sender's cat.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="pre-validation-relay-and-consistency-considerations">Pre-Validation Relay and Consistency Considerations</h3>
<ol>
<li>As high-bandwidth mode permits relaying of CMPCTBLOCK messages prior
to full validation (requiring only that the block header is valid
before relay), nodes SHOULD NOT ban a peer for announcing a new
block with a CMPCTBLOCK message that is invalid, but has a valid
header. For avoidance of doubt, nodes SHOULD bump their peer-to-peer
protocol version to 70015 or higher to signal that they will not ban
or punish a peer for announcing compact blocks prior to full
validation, and nodes SHOULD NOT announce a CMPCTBLOCK to a peer
with a version number below 70015 before fully validating the block.</li>
</ol>
<!-- end list -->
<ol>
<li>SPV nodes which implement this spec must consider the implications
of accepting blocks which were not validated by the node which
provided them. Especially SPV nodes which allow users to select a
&quot;trusted full node&quot; to sync from may wish to avoid implementing this
spec in high-bandwidth mode.</li>
</ol>
<!-- end list -->
<ol>
<li>Note that this spec does not change the requirement that nodes only
relay information about blocks which they have fully validated in
response to GETDATA/GETHEADERS/GETBLOCKS/etc requests. Nodes which
announce using CMPCTBLOCK message and then receive a request for
associated block data SHOULD ensure that messages do not go
unresponded to, and that the appropriate data is provided after the
block has been validated, subject to standard message-response
ordering requirements. Note that no requirement is added that the
node respond to the request with the new block included in eg
GETHEADERS or GETBLOCKS messages, but the node SHOULD re-announce
the block using the associated announcement methods after validation
has completed if it is not included in the original response. On the
other hand, nodes SHOULD delay responding to GETDATA requests for
the block until validation has completed, stalling all message
processing for the associated peer. REJECT messages are not
considered &quot;responses&quot; for the purpose of this section.</li>
</ol>
<!-- end list -->
<ol>
<li>As a result of the above requirements, implementors may wish to
consider the potential for the introduction of delays in responses
while remote peers validate blocks, avoiding delay-causing requests
where possible.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="justification">Justification</h2>
<h4 id="protocol-design">Protocol design</h4>
<p>There have been many proposals to save wire bytes when relaying blocks.
Many of them have a two-fold goal of reducing block relay time and thus
rely on the use of significant processing power in order to avoid
introducing additional worst-case RTTs. Because this work is not focused
primarily on reducing block relay time, its design is much simpler (ie
does not rely on set reconciliation protocols). Still, in testing at the
time of writing, nodes are able to relay blocks without the extra
getblocktxn/blocktxn RTT around 90% of the time. With a smart
compact-block-announcement policy, it is thus expected that this work
might allow blocks to be relayed between nodes in 0.5*RTT instead of
1.5*RTT at least 75% of the time.</p>
<h4 id="short-transaction-id-calculation">Short transaction ID calculation</h4>
<p>There are several design goals for the Short ID calculation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Performance</strong> The sender needs to compute short IDs for all block
transactions, and the receiver for all mempool transactions they are
being compared to. As we're easily talking about several thousand
transactions, sub-microsecond processing per-transactions is needed.</li>
<li><strong>Space</strong> cmpctblock messages are never optional in this protocol,
and contain a short ID for each non-prefilled transaction in the
block. Thus, the size of short IDs is directly proportional to the
maximum bandwidth savings possible.</li>
<li><strong>Collision resistance</strong> It should be hard for network participants
to create transactions that cause collisions. If an attacker were
able to cause such collisions, filling mempools (and, thus, blocks)
with them would cause poor network propagation of new (or
non-attacker, in the case of a miner) blocks.</li>
</ul>
<p>SipHash is a secure, fast, and simple 64-bit MAC designed for network
traffic authentication and collision-resistant hash tables. We truncate
the output from SipHash-2-4 to 48 bits (see next section) in order to
minimize space. The resulting 48-bit hash is certainly not large enough
to avoid intentionally created individual collisons, but by using the
block hash as a key to SipHash, an attacker cannot predict what keys
will be used once their transactions are actually included in a relayed
block. We mix in a per-connection 64-bit nonce to obtain independent
short IDs on every connection, so that even block creators cannot
control where collisions occur, and random collisions only ever affect a
small number of connections at any given time. The mixing is done using
SHA256(block_header || nonce), which is slow compared to SipHash, but
only done once per block. It also adds the ability for nodes to choose
the nonce in a better than random way to minimize collisions, though
that is not necessary for correct behaviour. Conversely, nodes can also
abuse this ability to increase their ability to introduce collisions in
the blocks they relay themselves. However, they can already cause more
problems by simply refusing to relay blocks. That is inevitable, and
this design only seeks to prevent network-wide misbehavior.</p>
<h4 id="random-collision-probabilty">Random collision probabilty</h4>
<p>Thanks to the block-header-based SipHash keys, we can assume that the
only collisions on links between honest nodes are random ones.</p>
<p>For each of the <em>t</em> block transactions, the receiver will compare its
received short ID with that of a set of <em>m</em> mempool transactions. We
assume that each of those <em>t</em> has a chance <em>r</em> to be included in that
set of <em>m</em>. If we use <em>B</em> bits short IDs, for each comparison between a
received short ID and a mempool transaction, there is a chance of *P = 1</p>
<ul>
<li>1 / 2^B* that a mismatch is detected as such.</li>
</ul>
<p>When comparing a given block transaction to the whole set of mempool
transactions, there are 5 cases to distinguish:</p>
<ol>
<li>The receiver has exactly one match, which is the correct one. This
has chance <em>r * P^(m - 1)</em>.</li>
<li>The receiver has no matches. This has chance <em>(1 - r) * P^m</em>.</li>
<li>The receiver has at least two matches, one of which is correct. This
has chance <em>r * (1 - P^(m - 1))</em>.</li>
<li>The receiver has at least two matches, both of which are incorrect.
This has chance <em>(1 - r) * (1 - P^m - m * (1 - P) * P^(m - 1))</em>.</li>
<li>The receiver has exactly one match, but an incorrect one. This has
chance <em>(1 - r) * m * (1 - P) * P^(m - 1)</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>(note that these 5 numbers always add up to 100%)</p>
<p>In case 1, we're good. In cases 2, 3, or 4, we request the full
transaction because we know we're uncertain. Only in case 5, we fail to
reconstruct. The chance that case 5 does not occur in any of the <em>t</em>
transactions in a block is <em>(1 - (1 - r) * m * (1 - P) * P^(m -
1))^t</em>. This expression is well approximated by *1 - (1 - r) * m * (1</p>
<ul>
<li>P) * t* = <em>1 - (1 - r) * m * t / 2^B</em>. Thus, if we want only one in
F block transmissions between honest nodes to fail under the
conservative <em>r = 0</em> assumption, we need <em>log2(F * m * t)</em> bits hash
functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>This means that <em>B = 48</em> bits short IDs suffice for blocks with up to <em>t
= 10000</em> transactions, mempools up to <em>m = 100000</em> transactions, with
failure to reconstruct at most one in <em>F = 281474</em> blocks. Since failure
to reconstruct just means we fall back to normal inv/header based relay,
it isn't necessary to avoid such failure completely. It just needs to be
sufficiently rare they have a lower impact than random transmission
failures (for example, network disconnection, node overloaded, ...).</p>
<h4 id="separate-version-for-segregated-witness">Separate version for segregated witness</h4>
<p>The changes to transaction and block relay in BIP 144 introduce separate
MSG_FILTERED_ versions of messages in getdata, allowing a receiver to
choose individually where witness data is wanted.</p>
<p>This method is not useful for compact blocks because `cmpctblock`
blocks can be sent unsolicitedly in high-bandwidth mode, so we need to
negotiate at least whether those should include witness data up front.
There is little use for a validating node that only sometimes processes
witness data, so we may as well use that negotiation for everything and
turn it into a separate protocol version. We also need a means to
distinguish different versions of the same transaction with different
witnesses for correct reconstruction, so this also forces us to use
wtxids instead of txids for short IDs everywhere in that case.</p>
