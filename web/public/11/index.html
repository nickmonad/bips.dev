</span></code></pre><h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This BIP proposes M-of-N-signatures required transactions as a new
'standard' transaction type.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Enable secured wallets, escrow transactions, and other use cases where
redeeming funds requires more than a single signature.</p>
<p>A couple of motivating use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>A wallet secured by a &quot;wallet protection service&quot; (WPS). 2-of-2
signatures required transactions will be used, with one signature
coming from the (possibly compromised) computer with the wallet and
the second signature coming from the WPS. When sending protected
bitcoins, the user's bitcoin client will contact the WPS with the
proposed transaction and it can then contact the user for
confirmation that they initiated the transaction and that the
transaction details are correct. Details for how clients and WPS's
communicate are outside the scope of this BIP. Side note: customers
should insist that their wallet protection service provide them with
copies of the private key(s) used to secure their wallets that they
can safely store off-line, so that their coins can be spent even if
the WPS goes out of business.</li>
</ul>
<!-- end list -->
<ul>
<li>Three-party escrow (buyer, seller, and trusted dispute agent).
2-of-3 signatures required transactions will be used. The buyer and
seller and agent will each provide a public key, and the buyer will
then send coins into a 2-of-3 CHECKMULTISIG transaction and send the
seller and the agent the transaction id. The seller will fulfill
their obligation and then ask the buyer to co-sign a transaction (
already signed by seller ) that sends the tied-up coins to him
(seller).<br />
If the buyer and seller cannot agree, then the agent can, with the
cooperation of either buyer or seller, decide what happens to the
tied-up coins. Details of how buyer, seller, and agent communicate
to gather signatures or public keys are outside the scope of this
BIP.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>
<p>A new standard transaction type (scriptPubKey) that is relayed by
clients and included in mined blocks:</p>
<p><code>   m {pubkey}...{pubkey} n OP_CHECKMULTISIG</code></p>
<p>But only for n less than or equal to 3.</p>
<p>OP_CHECKMULTISIG transactions are redeemed using a standard scriptSig:</p>
<p><code>   OP_0 ...signatures...</code></p>
<p>(OP_0 is required because of a bug in OP_CHECKMULTISIG; it pops one
too many items off the execution stack, so a dummy value must be placed
on the stack).</p>
<p>The current Satoshi bitcoin client does not relay or mine transactions
with scriptSigs larger than 200 bytes; to accommodate 3-signature
transactions, this will be increased to 500 bytes.</p>
<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>OP_CHECKMULTISIG is already an enabled opcode, and is the most
straightforward way to support several important use cases.</p>
<p>One argument against using OP_CHECKMULTISIG is that old clients and
miners count it as &quot;20 sigops&quot; for purposes of computing how many
signature operations are in a block, and there is a hard limit of 20,000
sigops per block-- meaning a maximum of 1,000 multisig transactions per
block. Creating multisig transactions using multiple OP_CHECKSIG
operations allows more of them per block.</p>
<p>The counter-argument is that these new multi-signature transactions will
be used in combination with OP_EVAL (see the OP_EVAL BIP), and
<strong>will</strong> be counted accurately. And in any case, as transaction volume
rises the hard-coded maximum block size will have to be addressed, and
the rules for counting number-of-signature-operations-in-a-block can be
addressed at that time.</p>
<p>A weaker argument is OP_CHECKMULTISIG should not be used because it
pops one too many items off the stack during validation. Adding an extra
OP_0 placeholder to the scriptSig adds only 1 byte to the transaction,
and any alternative that avoids OP_CHECKMULTISIG adds at least several
bytes of opcodes.</p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>OP_CHECKMULTISIG is already supported by old clients and miners as a
non-standard transaction type.</p>
