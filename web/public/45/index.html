  Comments-URI: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/wiki/Comments:BIP-0045
  Status: Proposed
  Type: Standards Track
  Created: 2014-04-25
</span></code></pre><h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This BIP defines a structure for hierarchical deterministic P2SH
multi-party multi-signature wallets (HDPM wallets from now on) based on
the algorithm described in BIP-0032 (BIP32 from now on) and purpose
scheme described in BIP-0043 (BIP43 from now on). This BIP is a
particular application of BIP43.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>The structure proposed in this document allows for standard ways to
create, use, import, and store HDPM wallets. It allows to handle
multiple parties sharing an m-of-n wallet, on the following assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>n parties share an m-of-n wallet.</li>
<li>Each party generates their master private keys independently.</li>
<li>Multisig P2SH is used for all addresses.</li>
<li>BIP32 is used to derive public keys, then create a multisig script,
and the corresponding P2SH address for that script.</li>
<li>Address generation should not require communication between parties.
(Thus, all parties must be able to generate all public keys)</li>
<li>Transaction creation and signing requires communication between
parties.</li>
</ul>
<p>This BIP will allow interoperability between various HDPM wallet
implementations.</p>
<h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>
<p>We define the following levels in BIP32 path:</p>
<p><code>m / purpose' / cosigner_index / change / address_index</code></p>
<p>Apostrophe in the path indicates that BIP32 hardened derivation is used.</p>
<p>Each level has special meaning described in the chapters below.</p>
<h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>
<p>Purpose is a constant set to 45, following the BIP43 recommendation. It
indicates that the subtree of this node is used according to this
specification.</p>
<p><code>m / 45' / *</code></p>
<p>Hardened derivation is used at this level.</p>
<h3 id="cosigner-index">Cosigner Index</h3>
<p>The index of the party creating a P2SH multisig address. The indices can
be determined independently by lexicographically sorting the purpose
public keys of each cosigner. Each cosigner creates addresses on its own
branch, even though they have independent extended master public key, as
explained in the &quot;Address generation&quot; section.</p>
<p>Note that the master public key is not shared amongst the cosigners.
Only the hardened purpose extended public key is shared, and this is
what is used to derive child extended public keys.</p>
<p>Software should only use indices corresponding to each of the N
cosigners sequentially. For example, for a 2-of-3 HDPM wallet, having
the following purpose public keys:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#fafafa;">
<code>03a473275a750a20b7b71ebeadfec83130c014da4b53f1c4743fcf342af6589a38
039863fb5f07b667d9b1ca68773c6e6cdbcac0088ffba9af46f6f6acd153d44463
03f76588e06c0d688617ef365d1e58a7f1aa84daa3801380b1e7f12acc9a69cd13
</code></pre>
<p>it should use <code>m / 45 ' / 0 / *</code> for
<code>039863fb5f07b667d9b1ca68773c6e6cdbcac0088ffba9af46f6f6acd153d44463</code>, <code>m / 45 ' / 1 / *</code> for
<code>03a473275a750a20b7b71ebeadfec83130c014da4b53f1c4743fcf342af6589a38</code>,
and <code>m / 45 ' / 2 / *</code> for
<code>03f76588e06c0d688617ef365d1e58a7f1aa84daa3801380b1e7f12acc9a69cd13</code>, as
dictated by their lexicographical order.</p>
<p>Software needs to discover all used indexes when importing the seed from
an external source. Such algorithm is described in &quot;Address discovery&quot;
chapter.</p>
<p>Non-hardened derivation is used at this level.</p>
<h3 id="change">Change</h3>
<p>Constant 0 is used for external chain and constant 1 for internal chain
(also known as change addresses). External chain is used for addresses
that are meant to be visible outside of the wallet (e.g. for receiving
payments). Internal chain is used for addresses which are not meant to
be visible outside of the wallet and is used for return transaction
change.</p>
<p>For example, if cosigner 2 wants to generate a change address, he would
use <code>m / 45 ' / 2 / 1 / *</code>, and <code>m / 45 ' / 2 / 0 / *</code> for a receive
address.</p>
<p>Non-hardened derivation is used at this level.</p>
<h3 id="address-index">Address Index</h3>
<p>Addresses are numbered from index 0 in sequentially increasing manner.
This number is used as child index in BIP32 derivation.</p>
<p>Non-hardened derivation is used at this level.</p>
<h3 id="hdpm-wallet-high-level-description">HDPM Wallet High-level Description</h3>
<p>Each party generates their own extended master keypair and shares the
extended purpose' public key with the others, which is stored encrypted.
Each party can generate any of the other's derived public keys, but only
his own private keys.</p>
<h3 id="address-generation-procedure">Address Generation Procedure</h3>
<p>When generating an address, each party can independently generate the N
needed public keys. They do this by deriving the public key in each of
the different trees, but using the same path. They can then generate the
multisig script (by lexicographically sorting the public keys) and the
corresponding p2sh address. In this way, each path corresponds to an
address, but the public keys for that address come from different trees.</p>
<h4 id="receive-address-case">Receive address case</h4>
<p>Each cosigner generates addresses only on his own branch. One of the n
cosigners wants to receive a payment, and the others are offline. He
knows the last used index in his own branch, because only he generates
addresses there. Thus, he can generate the public keys for all of the
others using the next index, and calculate the needed script for the
address.</p>
<p>Example: Cosigner #2 wants to receive a payment to the shared wallet.
His last used index on his own branch is 4. Then, the path for the next
receive address is <code>m/45'/2/0/5</code>. He uses this same path in all of the
cosigners trees to generate a public key for each one, and from that he
gets the new p2sh address.</p>
<h4 id="change-address-case">Change address case</h4>
<p>Again, each cosigner generates addresses only on his own branch. One of
the n cosigners wants to create an outgoing payment, for which he'll
need a change address. He generates a new address using the same
procedure as above, but using a separate index to track the used change
addresses.</p>
<p>Example: Cosigner #5 wants to send a payment from the shared wallet,
for which he'll need a change address. His last used change index on his
own branch is 11. Then, the path for the next change address is
<code>m/45'/5/1/12</code>. He uses this same path in all of the cosigners trees to
generate a public key for each one, and from that he gets the new p2sh
address.</p>
<h3 id="transaction-creation-and-signing">Transaction creation and signing</h3>
<p>When creating a transaction, first one of the parties creates a
Transaction Proposal. This is a transaction that spends some output
stored in any of the p2sh multisig addresses (corresponding to any of
the copayers' branches). This proposal is sent to the other parties, who
decide if they want to sign. If they approve the proposal, they can
generate their needed private key for that specific address (using the
same path that generated the public key in that address, but deriving
the private key instead), and sign it. Once the proposal reaches m
signatures, any cosigner can broadcast it to the network, becoming
final. The specifics of how this proposal is structured, and the
protocol to accept or reject it, belong to another BIP, in my opinion.</p>
<h3 id="address-discovery">Address discovery</h3>
<p>When the master seed is imported from an external source the software
should start to discover the addresses in the following manner:</p>
<ol>
<li>for each cosigner:</li>
<li>derive the cosigner's node (<code>m / 45' / cosigner_index</code>)</li>
<li>for both the external and internal chains on this node (<code>m / 45' / cosigner_index / 0</code> and <code>m / 45' / cosigner_index / 1</code>):</li>
<li>scan addresses of the chain; respect the gap limit described below</li>
</ol>
<p>Please note that the algorithm uses the transaction history, not address
balances, so even if the address has 0 coins, the program should
continue with discovery. Opposite to BIP44, each cosigner branch needs
to be checked, even if the earlier ones don't have transactions</p>
<h3 id="address-gap-limit">Address gap limit</h3>
<p>Address gap limit is currently set to 20. If the software hits 20 unused
addresses (no transactions associated with that address) in a row, it
expects there are no used addresses beyond this point and stops
searching the address chain.</p>
<p>Wallet software should warn when user is trying to exceed the gap limit
on an external chain by generating a new address.</p>
<h3 id="rationale">Rationale</h3>
<p>This structure provides a general way of doing HDPM wallets between
m-of-n parties. Here are some explanations about the design decisions
made.</p>
<p>The reason for using separate branches for each cosigner is we don't
want two of them generating the same address and receiving simultaneous
payments to it. The ideal case is that each address receives at most one
payment, requested by the corresponding cosigner.</p>
