<p>This BIP describes the use of normalized transaction IDs (NTXIDs) in
order to eliminate transaction malleability, both in the third-party
modification scenario as well as the participant modification scenario.
The transaction ID is normalized by removing the signature scripts from
transactions before computing its hash. The normalized transaction
hashes are then used during the signature creation and signature
verification of dependent transactions.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Transaction malleability refers to the fact that transactions can be
modified, either by one of the signers by re-signing the transaction or
a third-party by modifying the signature representation. This is a
problem since any modification to the serialized representation also
changes the hash of the transaction, which is used by spending
transaction to reference the funds that are being transferred. If a
transaction is modified and later confirmed by ending up in the
blockchain all transactions that depended on the original transaction
are no longer valid, and thus orphaned.</p>
<p>BIPs 62[1] and 66[2] alleviate the problem of third-party
modification by defining a canonical representation of the signatures.
However, checking the canonical representation is complex and may not
eliminate all sources of third-party malleability. Furthermore, these
BIPs do not address modifications by one of the signers, i.e.,
re-signing the transaction, because signers can produce any number of
signatures due to the random parameter in ECDSA.</p>
<p>This proposal eliminates malleability by removing the malleable
signatures from the hash used to reference the outputs spent by a
transaction. The new hash used to reference an output is called the
<em>normalized transaction ID</em>. The integrity of all data that is used to
reference the output is guaranteed by the signature itself, and any
modification that would change the normalized transaction ID would also
invalidate the signature itself.</p>
<p>Besides eliminating transaction malleability as a source of problems it
also allows the use of transaction templates. Transaction templates
simplify higher level protocols and allows new uses. They allow an
unsigned template transaction to be used as a basis for a sequence of
transaction and only once the sequence matches the signers' expectations
they provide the necessary signatures for the template to become valid,
thus opting in to the sequence.</p>
<h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>
<p>The use of normalized transaction IDs is introduced as a softfork. The
specification is divided into three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Computation of the normalized transaction ID</li>
<li>Introduction of a new extensible signature verification opcode to
enable softfork deployment</li>
<li>Changes to the UTXO tracking to enable normalized transaction ID
lookup</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="normalized-transaction-id-computation">Normalized Transaction ID computation</h3>
<p>In order to calculate the normalized transaction ID, the signature
script is stripped from each input of the transaction of non-coinbase
transactions and each input is normalized. Stripping the signature
script is achieved by setting the script's length to 0 and removing the
<code>uchar[]</code> array from the <code>TxIn</code>.[3] Inputs are then normalized by
replacing the hash of each previous transaction with its normalized
version if available, i.e., the normalized hash of the previous
transaction that created the output being spent in the current
transaction. Version 1 transactions do not have a normalized transaction
ID hence the non-normalized transaction ID is used for input
normalization.</p>
<p>The normalized transaction ID is then computed as the double <code>SHA 256</code>
hash of the normalized transaction matching the existing transaction ID
computation. The normalized transaction ID remains unchanged even if the
signatures of the transaction are replaced/malleated and describe a
class of semantically identical transactions. In the following we use
<em>transaction instance ID</em> to refer to the transaction ID computed on the
transaction including signatures. Normalized transaction IDs for
coinbase transactions are computed with the signature script in the
coinbase input, in order to avoid hash collisions.</p>
<h3 id="op-checksigex">OP_CHECKSIGEX</h3>
<p>This BIP introduces a new opcode <code>OP_CHECKSIGEX</code> which replaces
<code>OP_NOP4</code>. <code>OP_CHECKSIGEX</code> subsumes <code>OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY</code> and
<code>OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY</code>, and extends them by accepting a new <code>VERSION</code>
parameter. The version parameter is a single integer pushed onto the
stack before invoking <code>OP_CHECKSIGEX</code> and is used to group and evolve
future versions of signature checking opcodes.</p>
<p>When executed <code>OP_CHECKSIGEX</code> pops the version from the stack and then
performs the signature check according to the specified version. If the
verifying client does not support the specified version, i.e., the
version was defined after the release of the client, the client must
treat the <code>OP_CHECKSIGEX</code> as an <code>OP_NOP</code>.</p>
<h4 id="version-1">Version 1</h4>
<p>The first version of <code>OP_CHECKSIGEX</code> (<code>VERSION=1</code>) implements normalized
transaction IDs and uses Schnorr signatures instead of the current ECDSA
signatures.</p>
<p>Version 1 introduces the following new standard script format:</p>
<p><code>   m {pubkey}...{pubkey} n v OP_CHECKSIGEX</code></p>
<p>with matching scriptSig format:</p>
<p><code>   {signature}...{signature}</code></p>
<p>This is the standard <em>m-of-n</em> script defined in
<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0011.mediawiki">BIP 11</a>
with an additional version parameter <code>v</code> and the new opcode. Singlesig
transactions are encoded as <em>1-of-1</em> transactions.</p>
<p>The existing <code>OP_CHECKMULTISIG</code> and <code>OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY</code> have a
bug[4] that pops one argument too many from the stack. This bug is not
reproduced in the implementation of OP_CHECKSIGEX, so the canonical
solution of pushing a dummy value onto the stack is not necessary.</p>
<p>The normalization is achieved by normalizing the transaction before
computing the signaturehash, i.e., the hash that is signed. The
transaction must be normalized by replacing all transaction IDs in the
inputs by their normalized variants and stripping the signature scripts.
The normalized transction IDs are computed as described in the previous
section. This normalization step is performed both when creating the
signatures as well as when checking the signatures.</p>
<h3 id="tracking-normalized-transaction-ids">Tracking Normalized Transaction IDs</h3>
<p>The transaction version is bumped to 2. The new version signals to
clients receiving the transaction that they should track the normalized
transaction ID along with the transaction instance ID in the unspent
transaction output (UTXO) set. Upon receiving a version 2 transaction
the client computes the normalized transaction ID, annotates the outputs
with it, and adds them into the UTXO set indexed by the transaction
instance ID as before. Transactions continue using the transaction
instance ID to reference the outputs, but while checking the signature
they may get normalized. All network messages continue to use the
transaction instance ID to reference the transaction, specifically
<code>inv</code>, <code>getdata</code>, <code>tx</code> and <code>block</code> messages still use transaction
instance IDs, not the normalized transaction IDs.</p>
<p>Outputs created by version 1 transactions are not annotated with the
normalized transaction ID, and when normalizing the hashes in
transaction inputs referencing version 1 outputs are not modified.</p>
<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>
<h3 id="normalization">Normalization</h3>
<p>Normalized transaction IDs are provably non-malleable since no data is
included in the signaturehash whose integrity is not also proven in the
signature, thus any modification causing the hash to change will also
invalidate the signature. Normalized transactions are secure as they
still use cryptographic hashes over all the semantic information of the
transaction, i.e., the inputs, outputs and metadata, thus it is still
computationally infeasible to cause a hash collision between
transactions.</p>
<p>There are a number of advantages to using normalized transaction IDs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Like BIP 62 and BIP 66 it solves the problem of third-parties
picking transactions out of the network, modifying them and
reinjecting them.</li>
<li><em>m-of-n</em> multisig outputs are often used in higher level
protocols[5]<ref>[[<a href="http://lightning.network/lightning-network-paper.pdf%7CThe">http://lightning.network/lightning-network-paper.pdf|The</a>
Bitcoin Lightning Network:</li>
</ul>
<p>Scalable Off-Chain Instant Payments]]</ref> in which several parties
sign a transaction. Without normalized transaction IDs it is trivial for
one party to re-sign a transaction, hence changing the transaction hash
and invalidating any transaction built on top of its outputs. Normalized
transaction IDs force the ID not to change, even if a party replaces its
signature.</p>
<ul>
<li>Many higher level protocols build structures of transactions on top
of multisig outputs that are not completely signed. This is
currently not possible without one party holding a fully signed
transaction and then calculating the ID. It is desirable to be able
to build successive transactions without one party collecting all
signatures, and thus possibly lock in funds unilaterally. Normalized
transaction IDs allow the use of transaction templates, i.e.,
completely unsigned transactions upon which further transactions can
be built, and only once every party is assured the structure matches
its expectations it signs the template, thus validating the
template.</li>
</ul>
<p>The only occurrence in which transactions can still be modified
unilaterally is in the case <code>SIGHASH_NONE</code>, <code>SIGHASH_SINGLE</code> or
<code>SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY</code> is used. This however is not problematic since in
these cases the creator of the transaction explicitly allows
modification.</p>
<p>In case of a transaction becoming invalid due to one of the inputs being
malleated it is necessary to modify the spending transaction to
reference the modified transaction ID. However, the signatures, which
only use the normalized IDs, remain valid as long as the semantics of
the funding transaction remain unchanged. An observer in the network may
fix the transaction and reinject a corrected version.</p>
<p>Using version 2 for transactions is an explicit opt-in to the normalized
ID tracking and a simple upgrade for existing clients. It avoids having
to reprocess the entire blockchain and computing the normalized
transaction IDs for existing outputs in the UTXO. This would be further
complicated by having to recursively compute normalized transaction IDs
down to the coinbase transactions which created the coins.</p>
<p>Tracking the normalized transaction IDs in the UTXO requires the storage
of an additional hash per transaction whose outputs are not completely
spent, which at 7,000,000 transactions with unspent outputs amounts to
224MB additional storage on disk.</p>
<p>The coinbase transactions have been checked for hash-collisions and no
collisions were found except for the coinbase transactions in blocks at
heights 91842 and 91880, which are known to be identical[6], and
motivated the introduction of BIP 34.[7] Since coinbase transactions
are invalid if transmitted outside of a block it is not possible to
modify them on the fly and since they only mature after being included
for a long time in the blockchain they are considered safe.</p>
<h3 id="op-checksigex-1">OP_CHECKSIGEX</h3>
<p>The new opcode <code>OP_CHECKSIGEX</code> was introduced in order to allow the use
of normalized transaction IDs as a softfork and in order to keep the
number of <code>OP_NOP</code>s needed to a bare minimum, while enabling future
soft-fork updates to the signing algorithms.</p>
<p>The additional argument containing the version can be pushed on the
stack using a single byte up to version 16 (<code>OP_1</code> - <code>OP_16</code>), resulting
in one byte overhead for this script type. Using the standard multisig
format also for 1-of-1 transactions add an additional 2 bytes, however
it also removes the bug requiring a dummy push, resulting in a single
byte overhead. Furthermore, using Schnorr signatures instead of ECDSA
brings a number of improvements that reduce the size of transactions
(<em>m-of-m</em> is the same size as <em>1-of-1</em>) and increase verification speed
(batch signature validation by summing up keys and signatures). The code
is already in bitcoin/secp256k1 and can be merged in. We limited the
description of this BIP to re-using BIP 11 style <em>m-of-n</em> scripts to
keep it short, however Schnorr also allows a number of more complex
applications which we defer to future BIPs.</p>
<p>Version 0 was intentionally skipped in order to guarantee that the
top-most element before <code>OP_CHECKSIGEX</code> is non-zero. This is necessary
to guarantee that non-upgraded clients, which interpret <code>OP_CHECKSIGEX</code>
as <code>OP_NOP4</code>, do not end up with a zero value on top of the stack after
execution, which would be interpreted as script failure.</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>This is a softfork which replaces <code>OP_NOP4</code> with the new implementation
of <code>OP_CHECKSIGEX</code>, as such the impact on the network is minimal.
Wallets that do not implement this opcode will not be able to verify the
validity of the scripts, however if transactions using <code>OP_CHECKSIGEX</code>
are included in blocks they will accept them and track the inputs
correctly. This is guaranteed since the transaction inputs still use the
non-normalized transaction ID to reference the outputs to be claimed,
hence non-upgraded wallets can still lookup the outputs and mark them as
spent. Furthermore, clients that do not implement this BIP are unable to
identify outputs using this script as their own, however upgrading and
rescanning the blockchain will make them available.</p>
