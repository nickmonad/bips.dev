</span></code></pre><h2 id="what-is-a-bip">What is a BIP?</h2>
<p>BIP stands for Bitcoin Improvement Proposal. A BIP is a design document
providing information to the Bitcoin community, or describing a new
feature for Bitcoin or its processes or environment. The BIP should
provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale
for the feature.</p>
<p>We intend BIPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new features,
for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the
design decisions that have gone into Bitcoin. The BIP author is
responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting
dissenting opinions.</p>
<p>Because the BIPs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository,
their revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal.</p>
<h2 id="bip-types">BIP Types</h2>
<p>There are three kinds of BIP:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Standards Track BIP describes any change that affects most or all
Bitcoin implementations, such as a change to the network protocol, a
change in block or transaction validity rules, or any change or
addition that affects the interoperability of applications using
Bitcoin.</li>
<li>An Informational BIP describes a Bitcoin design issue, or provides
general guidelines or information to the Bitcoin community, but does
not propose a new feature. Informational BIPs do not necessarily
represent a Bitcoin community consensus or recommendation, so users
and implementors are free to ignore Informational BIPs or follow
their advice.</li>
<li>A Process BIP describes a process surrounding Bitcoin, or proposes a
change to (or an event in) a process. Process BIPs are like
Standards Track BIPs but apply to areas other than the Bitcoin
protocol itself. They may propose an implementation, but not to
Bitcoin's codebase; they often require community consensus; unlike
Informational BIPs, they are more than recommendations, and users
are typically not free to ignore them. Examples include procedures,
guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and changes to
the tools or environment used in Bitcoin development. Any meta-BIP
is also considered a Process BIP.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bip-work-flow">BIP Work Flow</h2>
<p>The BIP process begins with a new idea for Bitcoin. Each potential BIP
must have a champion -- someone who writes the BIP using the style and
format described below, shepherds the discussions in the appropriate
forums, and attempts to build community consensus around the idea. The
BIP champion (a.k.a. Author) should first attempt to ascertain whether
the idea is BIP-able. Posting to the
<a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-dev">bitcoin-dev@lists.linuxfoundation.org</a>
mailing list (and maybe the <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=6.0">Development &amp; Technical
Discussion</a> forum) is the
best way to go about this.</p>
<p>Vetting an idea publicly before going as far as writing a BIP is meant
to save both the potential author and the wider community time. Many
ideas have been brought forward for changing Bitcoin that have been
rejected for various reasons. Asking the Bitcoin community first if an
idea is original helps prevent too much time being spent on something
that is guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions (searching
the internet does not always do the trick). It also helps to make sure
the idea is applicable to the entire community and not just the author.
Just because an idea sounds good to the author does not mean it will
work for most people in most areas where Bitcoin is used. Small
enhancements or patches often don't need standardisation between
multiple projects; these don't need a BIP and should be injected into
the relevant Bitcoin development work flow with a patch submission to
the applicable Bitcoin issue tracker.</p>
<p>Once the champion has asked the Bitcoin community as to whether an idea
has any chance of acceptance, a draft BIP should be presented to the
<a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-dev">bitcoin-dev</a>
mailing list. This gives the author a chance to flesh out the draft BIP
to make it properly formatted, of high quality, and to address
additional concerns about the proposal. Following a discussion, the
proposal should be sent to the bitcoin-dev list and the BIP editor with
the draft BIP. This draft must be written in BIP style as described
below, else it will be sent back without further regard until proper
formatting rules are followed.</p>
<p>BIP authors are responsible for collecting community feedback on both
the initial idea and the BIP before submitting it for review. However,
wherever possible, long open-ended discussions on public mailing lists
should be avoided. Strategies to keep the discussions efficient include:
setting up a separate SIG mailing list for the topic, having the BIP
author accept private comments in the early design phases, setting up a
wiki page or git repository, etc. BIP authors should use their
discretion here.</p>
<p>It is highly recommended that a single BIP contain a single key proposal
or new idea. The more focused the BIP, the more successful it tends to
be. If in doubt, split your BIP into several well-focused ones.</p>
<p>The BIP editors assign BIP numbers and change their status. Please send
all BIP-related email to the BIP editor, which is listed under <a href="https://bips.dev/1/#BIP_Editors" title="wikilink">BIP
Editors</a> below. Also see <a href="https://bips.dev/1/#BIP_Editor_Responsibilities_Workflow" title="wikilink">BIP Editor
Responsibilities &amp;
Workflow</a>. The BIP
editor reserves the right to reject BIP proposals if they appear too
unfocused or too broad.</p>
<p>Authors MUST NOT self assign BIP numbers, but should use an alias such
as &quot;bip-johndoe-infinitebitcoins&quot; which includes the author's name/nick
and the BIP subject.</p>
<p>If the BIP editor approves, he will assign the BIP a number, label it as
Standards Track, Informational, or Process, give it status &quot;Draft&quot;, and
add it to the BIPs git repository. The BIP editor will not unreasonably
deny a BIP. Reasons for denying BIP status include duplication of
effort, disregard for formatting rules, being too unfocused or too
broad, being technically unsound, not providing proper motivation or
addressing backwards compatibility, or not in keeping with the Bitcoin
philosophy. For a BIP to be accepted it must meet certain minimum
criteria. It must be a clear and complete description of the proposed
enhancement. The enhancement must represent a net improvement. The
proposed implementation, if applicable, must be solid and must not
complicate the protocol unduly.</p>
<p>The BIP author may update the Draft as necessary in the git repository.
Updates to drafts may also be submitted by the author as pull requests.</p>
<p>Standards Track BIPs consist of two parts, a design document and a
reference implementation. The BIP should be reviewed and accepted before
a reference implementation is begun, unless a reference implementation
will aid people in studying the BIP. Standards Track BIPs must include
an implementation -- in the form of code, a patch, or a URL to same --
before it can be considered Final.</p>
<p>Once a BIP has been accepted, the reference implementation must be
completed. When the reference implementation is complete and accepted by
the community, the status will be changed to &quot;Final&quot;.</p>
<p>A BIP can also be assigned status &quot;Deferred&quot;. The BIP author or editor
can assign the BIP this status when no progress is being made on the
BIP. Once a BIP is deferred, the BIP editor can re-assign it to draft
status.</p>
<p>A BIP can also be &quot;Rejected&quot;. Perhaps after all is said and done it was
not a good idea. It is still important to have a record of this fact.</p>
<p>BIPs can also be superseded by a different BIP, rendering the original
obsolete. This is intended for Informational BIPs, where version 2 of an
API can replace version 1.</p>
<p>The possible paths of the status of BIPs are as follows:</p>
<p><img src=bip-0001/process.png></img></p>
<p>Some Informational and Process BIPs may also have a status of &quot;Active&quot;
if they are never meant to be completed. E.g. BIP 1 (this BIP).</p>
<h2 id="what-belongs-in-a-successful-bip">What belongs in a successful BIP?</h2>
<p>Each BIP should have the following parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preamble -- RFC 822 style headers containing meta-data about the
BIP, including the BIP number, a short descriptive title (limited to
a maximum of 44 characters), the names, and optionally the contact
info for each author, etc.</li>
</ul>
<!-- end list -->
<ul>
<li>Abstract -- a short (~200 word) description of the technical issue
being addressed.</li>
</ul>
<!-- end list -->
<ul>
<li>Copyright/public domain -- Each BIP must either be explicitly
labelled as placed in the public domain (see this BIP as an example)
or licensed under the Open Publication License.</li>
</ul>
<!-- end list -->
<ul>
<li>Specification -- The technical specification should describe the
syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be
detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations
for any of the current Bitcoin platforms (Satoshi, BitcoinJ,
bitcoin-js, libbitcoin).</li>
</ul>
<!-- end list -->
<ul>
<li>Motivation -- The motivation is critical for BIPs that want to
change the Bitcoin protocol. It should clearly explain why the
existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem
that the BIP solves. BIP submissions without sufficient motivation
may be rejected outright.</li>
</ul>
<!-- end list -->
<ul>
<li>Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by
describing what motivated the design and why particular design
decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were
considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in
other languages.</li>
</ul>
<!-- end list -->
<ul>
<li>The rationale should provide evidence of consensus within the
community and discuss important objections or concerns raised during
discussion.</li>
</ul>
<!-- end list -->
<ul>
<li>Backwards Compatibility -- All BIPs that introduce backwards
incompatibilities must include a section describing these
incompatibilities and their severity. The BIP must explain how the
author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. BIP
submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise
may be rejected outright.</li>
</ul>
<!-- end list -->
<ul>
<li>Reference Implementation -- The reference implementation must be
completed before any BIP is given status &quot;Final&quot;, but it need not be
completed before the BIP is accepted. It is better to finish the
specification and rationale first and reach consensus on it before
writing code.</li>
</ul>
<!-- end list -->
<ul>
<li>The final implementation must include test code and documentation
appropriate for the Bitcoin protocol.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bip-formats-and-templates">BIP Formats and Templates</h2>
<p>BIPs should be written in mediawiki or markdown format.</p>
<h3 id="bip-header-preamble">BIP Header Preamble</h3>
<p>Each BIP must begin with an RFC 822 style header preamble. The headers
must appear in the following order. Headers marked with &quot;*&quot; are
optional and are described below. All other headers are required.</p>
<pre style="background-color:#fafafa;">
<code><span style="color:#61676c;">  BIP: &lt;BIP number&gt;
  Title: &lt;BIP title&gt;
  Author: &lt;list of authors&#39; real names and optionally, email addrs&gt;
* Discussions-To: &lt;email address&gt;
  Status: &lt;Draft | Active | Accepted | Deferred | Rejected |
           Withdrawn | Final | Superseded&gt;
  Type: &lt;Standards Track | Informational | Process&gt;
  Created: &lt;date created on, in ISO 8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format&gt;
* Post-History: &lt;dates of postings to bitcoin mailing list&gt;
* Replaces: &lt;BIP number&gt;
* Superseded-By: &lt;BIP number&gt;
* Resolution: &lt;url&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>The Author header lists the names, and optionally the email addresses of
all the authors/owners of the BIP. The format of the Author header value
must be</p>
<p><code> Random J. User &lt;address@dom.ain&gt;</code></p>
<p>if the email address is included, and just</p>
<p><code> Random J. User</code></p>
<p>if the address is not given.</p>
<p>If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line
following RFC 2822 continuation line conventions.</p>
<p>Note: The Resolution header is required for Standards Track BIPs only.
It contains a URL that should point to an email message or other web
resource where the pronouncement about the BIP is made.</p>
<p>While a BIP is in private discussions (usually during the initial Draft
phase), a Discussions-To header will indicate the mailing list or URL
where the BIP is being discussed. No Discussions-To header is necessary
if the BIP is being discussed privately with the author, or on the
bitcoin email mailing lists.</p>
<p>The Type header specifies the type of BIP: Standards Track,
Informational, or Process.</p>
<p>The Created header records the date that the BIP was assigned a number,
while Post-History is used to record the dates of when new versions of
the BIP are posted to bitcoin mailing lists. Both headers should be in
yyyy-mm-dd format, e.g. 2001-08-14.</p>
<p>BIPs may have a Requires header, indicating the BIP numbers that this
BIP depends on.</p>
<p>BIPs may also have a Superseded-By header indicating that a BIP has been
rendered obsolete by a later document; the value is the number of the
BIP that replaces the current document. The newer BIP must have a
Replaces header containing the number of the BIP that it rendered
obsolete.</p>
<h3 id="auxiliary-files">Auxiliary Files</h3>
<p>BIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams. Image files should be
included in a subdirectory for that BIP. Auxiliary files must be named
BIP-XXXX-Y.ext, where &quot;XXXX&quot; is the BIP number, &quot;Y&quot; is a serial number
(starting at 1), and &quot;ext&quot; is replaced by the actual file extension
(e.g. &quot;png&quot;).</p>
<h2 id="transferring-bip-ownership">Transferring BIP Ownership</h2>
<p>It occasionally becomes necessary to transfer ownership of BIPs to a new
champion. In general, we'd like to retain the original author as a
co-author of the transferred BIP, but that's really up to the original
author. A good reason to transfer ownership is because the original
author no longer has the time or interest in updating it or following
through with the BIP process, or has fallen off the face of the 'net
(i.e. is unreachable or not responding to email). A bad reason to
transfer ownership is because you don't agree with the direction of the
BIP. We try to build consensus around a BIP, but if that's not possible,
you can always submit a competing BIP.</p>
<p>If you are interested in assuming ownership of a BIP, send a message
asking to take over, addressed to both the original author and the BIP
editor. If the original author doesn't respond to email in a timely
manner, the BIP editor will make a unilateral decision (it's not like
such decisions can't be reversed :).</p>
<h2 id="bip-editors">BIP Editors</h2>
<p>The current BIP editor is Luke Dashjr who can be contacted at
<a href="mailto:luke_bipeditor@dashjr.org" title="wikilink">luke_bipeditor@dashjr.org</a>.</p>
<h2 id="bip-editor-responsibilities-workflow">BIP Editor Responsibilities &amp; Workflow</h2>
<p>The BIP editor subscribes to the Bitcoin development mailing list. All
BIP-related correspondence should be sent (or CC'd) to
luke_bipeditor@dashjr.org.</p>
<p>For each new BIP that comes in an editor does the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read the BIP to check if it is ready: sound and complete. The ideas
must make technical sense, even if they don't seem likely to be
accepted.</li>
<li>The title should accurately describe the content.</li>
<li>Edit the BIP for language (spelling, grammar, sentence structure,
etc.), markup (for reST BIPs), code style (examples should match BIP
8 &amp; 7).</li>
</ul>
<p>If the BIP isn't ready, the editor will send it back to the author for
revision, with specific instructions.</p>
<p>Once the BIP is ready for the repository it should be submitted as a
&quot;pull request&quot; to the <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips">bitcoin/bips</a>
repository on GitHub where it may get further feedback.</p>
<p>The BIP editor will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assign a BIP number (almost always just the next available number,
but sometimes it's a special/joke number, like 666 or 3141) in the
pull request comments.</li>
</ul>
<!-- end list -->
<ul>
<li>Merge the pull request when the author is ready (allowing some time
for further peer review).</li>
</ul>
<!-- end list -->
<ul>
<li>List the BIP in <a href="https://bips.dev/1/README.mediawiki" title="wikilink">README.mediawiki</a></li>
</ul>
<!-- end list -->
<ul>
<li>Send email back to the BIP author with next steps (post to
bitcoin-dev mailing list).</li>
</ul>
<p>The BIP editors are intended to fulfill administrative and editorial
responsibilities. The BIP editors monitor BIP changes, and correct any
structure, grammar, spelling, or markup mistakes we see.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>This document was derived heavily from Python's PEP-0001. In many places
text was simply copied and modified. Although the PEP-0001 text was
written by Barry Warsaw, Jeremy Hylton, and David Goodger, they are not
responsible for its use in the Bitcoin Improvement Process, and should
not be bothered with technical questions specific to Bitcoin or the BIP
process. Please direct all comments to the BIP editors or the Bitcoin
development mailing list.</p>
<h2 id="changelog">Changelog</h2>
<p>10 Oct 2015 - Added clarifications about submission process and BIP
number assignment.</p>
<p>01 Jan 2016 - Clarified early stages of BIP idea championing, collecting
community feedback, etc.</p>
