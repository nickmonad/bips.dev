</span></code></pre><h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This BIP attempts to create a taxonomy of the different types of
consensus forks and proposes a deployment mechanism for each of them.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>The security assumptions of p2p consensus-based systems like Bitcoin are
not always well-understood, and the best upgrade mechanisms to the
consensus validation rules may vary depending on the type of change
being deployed. Discussing such changes without a uniform view on the
deployment paths often leads to misunderstandings and unnecessarily
delays the deployment of changes.</p>
<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Software fork<br />
A copy of an existing project. In free software, this can be done
without the permission of the original project's maintainers.</li>
</ul>
<!-- end list -->
<ul>
<li>Consensus fork<br />
A divergence in the implementation of the verification consensus
rules can impede the expected eventual convergence of the network in
a single chain that has the most proof of work and also satisfies
the rules. This can be intentional or be caused by a bug in
consensus validation reimplementations.</li>
</ul>
<!-- end list -->
<ul>
<li>Softfork<br />
A consensus fork wherein everything that was previously invalid
remains invalid while blocks that would have previously considered
valid become invalid. A hashrate majority of miners can impose the
new rules. They have some deployment advantages like backward
compatibility.</li>
</ul>
<!-- end list -->
<ul>
<li>Hardfork<br />
A consensus fork that makes previously invalid blocks valid.
Hardforks require all users to upgrade.</li>
</ul>
<!-- end list -->
<ul>
<li>Libconsensus<br />
a theoretical piece of software that contains the specifications
that define the validity of a block for a given state and chain
parameters (ie it may act differently on, for example, regtest).</li>
</ul>
<!-- end list -->
<ul>
<li>Libbitcoinconsensus<br />
the existing implementation is a library that is compiled by default
with Bitcoin Core master and exposes a single C function named
bitcoinconsensus_verify_script(). Although it has a deterministic
build and implements the most complex rules (most of the
cryptography, which is itself heavily based on libsecp256k1 after
#REPLACE_libsecp256k1_PR), it is still not a complete
specification of the consensus rules. Since libconsensus doesn't
manage the current state but only the validation of the next block
given that state, it is known that this long effort of encapsulation
and decoupling will eventually finish, and that the person who moves
the last line</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="taxonomy-of-consensus-forks">Taxonomy of consensus forks</h2>
<h3 id="accidental-consensus-fork">Accidental consensus fork</h3>
<p>Software forks are very different in nature from consensus rules forks.
No software maintainer has special powers over consensus rules changes.
There's many good reasons (experimentation, lack of features,
independent development, diversity, etc) to fork the Bitcoin Core
software and it's good that there's many alternative implementations of
the protocol (forks of Bitcoin Core or written from scratch).</p>
<p>But sometimes a bug in the reimplementaion of the consensus validation
rules can prevent users of alternative implementation from following the
longest (most work) valid chain. This can result in those users losing
coins or being defrauded, making reimplementations of the consensus
validation rules very risky. Note that a natural language specification
of those rules doesn't help since the consensus is not determined by
such specification but by the software that the majority of the network
runs. That's why &quot;the implementation is the specification&quot;.</p>
<p>But Bitcoin Core contains many more things than just consensus
validation and it would be unreasonable for all alternative
implementations to depend on it. Bitcoin Core should not be the
specification. That's why the consensus validation is being separated
into a libbitcoinconsensus library with a C API easily accessible from
any language. This makes alternative implementations much more secure
without burdening them with specific design choices made by Bitcoin
Core. It is to be noted that sharing the same code for consensus
validation doesn't prevent alternative implementations from
independently changing their consensus rules: they can always fork the
libbitcoinconsensus project (once it is in a separate repository).</p>
<p>Hopefully libbitcoinconsensus will remove this type of consensus fork
which - being accidental - obviously doesn't need a deployment plan.</p>
<h4 id="11-12-march-2013-chain-fork">11/12 March 2013 Chain Fork</h4>
<p>There is a precedent of an accidental consensus fork at height 225430.
Without entering into much detail (see [2]), the situation was
different from what's being described from the alternative
implementation risks (today alternative implementation still usually
rely in different degrees on Bitcoin Core trusted proxies, which is very
reasonable considering the lack of a complete libconsensus). The two
conflicting consensus validation implementations were two different
versions of Bitcoin Core (Bitcoin-qt at the time): 0.8 against all
versions prior to it. Most miners had been fast on upgrading to 0.8 and
they were also fast on downgrading to 0.7 as an emergency when they were
asked to by the developers community.</p>
<p>A short summary would be that BDB was being abandoned in favor of
levelDB, and - at the same time - the miner's policy block size limit
was being lift (it was not a consensus rule, not even enforced via
softfork). Even after testing, a case where levelDB couldn't correctly
validate certain bigger blocks only appeared after deployment in
production. Fortunately this was handled very well and rapidly by the
whole worldwide community and nobody is unhappy about the solution.</p>
<p>But there's some philosophical disagreements on the terms of what the
solution was: we can add a pedantic note on that. If &quot;the implementation
is the specification&quot;, then those levelDB-specific limitations were part
of the consensus rules. Then additional rules were necessary and any
alternative implementation (including 0.8) would have to implement it.
Then a planned consensus fork to migrate all Bitcoin-qt 0.7- users could
remove those additional consensus restrictions. Had libconsensus being
implemented without depending on levelDB, those additional restrictions
wouldn't have been part of &quot;the specification&quot;</p>
<p><code>and this would just have been a bug in the</code></p>
<p>consensus rules, just a consensus-critical bug in a set of
implementations, concretely all satoshi-bitcoin-0.7-or-less (which
happened to be a huge super majority of the users), but other
implementations (like libbitcoin) would be free from such bug and
implementing the correct libconsensus specification. But since the buggy
implementation was a super-majority, the solution would have been to
instantly (from a specific block) change the rules to not let the
super-majority deviate from the specification and then have another
consensus fork to remove them. Two theoretical consensus forks instead
of one but the first one deployed practically for free. The practical
result would have been identical and only the definitions change. This
means discussing something that went uncontroversially well further is
&quot;philosophical bike-shed&quot; (TM).</p>
<h3 id="unilateral-softforks">Unilateral softforks</h3>
<p>If it is in their best interest of miners to softfork it should be
assumed that they may likely enforce it. In some cases, even against the
will of a super-majority of users. This is practically an attack on the
network and the only solution is to carefully design the incentives so
that the case is simply impossible. If that fails, miners should still
consider the risk of motivating a schism hardfork before attempting such
a consensus fork. A deployment plan for this case is also unnecessary.</p>
<h3 id="schism-hardforks">Schism hardforks</h3>
<p>Fundamental disagreements and controversies are part of social systems,
like the one defined as the human participants in the Bitcoin network.
Without judging the motivation of the rule discrepancies or what rules
were in place first, we're defining schism[1] hardforks as those in
which - for whatever reason - users are consiously going to validate 2
different sets of consensus rules. Since they will validate different
rulesets, they will end up following 2 different chains for at least
some time, maybe forever.</p>
<p>One possible result observed in the
past[non_proportional_inflatacoin_fork] is that one of the chains
rapidly disappears, but nothing indicates that this must always be the
case.</p>
<p>While 2 chains cohexist, they can be considered two different
currencies. We could say that bitcoin becomes bitcoinA and bitcoinB. The
implications for market capitalization are completely unpredictable,</p>
<p>maybe mc(bitcoinA) = mc(bitcoinB) = mc(old_bitcoin),</p>
<p>maybe mc(bitcoinA) + mc(bitcoinB) = mc(old_bitcoin),</p>
<p>maybe mc(bitcoinA) + mc(bitcoinB) = 1000 * mc(old_bitcoin),</p>
<p>maybe mc(bitcoinA) + mc(bitcoinB) = 0,</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Schism hardforks have been compared to one type of altcoins called
&quot;spinoffs&quot;[spinoffs] that distribute all or part of its initial
seigniorage to bitcoin owners at a given block height.</p>
<p>This is very disruptive and hopefully will never be needed. But if it's
needed the best deployment path is just to activate the rule changes
after certain block height in the future. On the other hand, it is
healthy decentralization-wise that many independent software projects
are ready to deploy a schism hardfork.</p>
<p>In all of the following examples there's clearly a confrontation that is
being resolved using an intentional consensus hardfork.</p>
<h4 id="asic-reset-hardfork">ASIC-reset hardfork</h4>
<p>Imagine ASIC production has been consolidated to a single company and
distribution is simply not happening: the company is keeping them to
mine itself. For that or another reason, a single entity controls 40%+
of the hashrate and there's no hope for an spontaneous improvement in
decentralization. Such an untenable centralization could be fixed (with
great risks) by switching the hash function used in the proof of work,
effectively &quot;pressing the restart button&quot; on the ASIC market. The next
function should be simple to implement in ASIC as well so that the
market can more easily develop as a healthy and competitive one (as
opposed to what the &quot;ASIC-hard&quot; proponents would want), but that's
another story...]</p>
<p>Since in this case the confrontation is clearly against the current
miners any notion of &quot;miners' voting&quot; is utterly irrelevant.</p>
<h4 id="anti-block-creator-hardfork">Anti-Block-creator hardfork</h4>
<p>There's less extreme cases where changing the pow function would not be
necessary. For example, let's imagine a bright future where commoditized
ASICs are running in millions home-heaters all over the world, but the
block size has been completely removed and the network has devolved to a
very centralized system where only 2 big pools have the resources to
fully validate full blocks and create block templates with competitive
levels of transaction fees. In that case, changing the pow function
would be a terrible waste and a risk that could be avoided. A hardfork
restoring a block size limit could help fixing this situation. Please
don't take it as an argument for or against raising the block size
limit: it's just an example. But in this case, again, those 2 big pools
would probably be against the fork and, again, their voting is
irrelevant.</p>
<p>Like in the previous example, miners are expected to oppose and they
have to be ignored.</p>
<h4 id="anti-cabal-hardfork">Anti-cabal hardfork</h4>
<p>Let's imagine BIP66 had a crypto backdoor that nobody noticed and allows
an evil developer cabal to steal everyone's coins. The users and
non-evil developers could join, fork libconsensus and use the forked
version in their respective bitcoin implementations. Should miner's
&quot;vote&quot; be required to express their consent? What if some miners are
part of the cabal? In the unlikely event that most miners are part of
such an evil cabal, changing the pow function may be required. In other
cases, mining &quot;vote&quot; doesn't have much value either since this kind of
hardfork would not qualify as uncontroversial anyway.</p>
<h3 id="uncontroversial-consensus-upgrades">Uncontroversial consensus upgrades</h3>
<p>&quot;Uncontroversial&quot; is something tough to define in this context. What if
a single user decides he won't upgrade no matter what and he doesn't
even attempt to explain his decision? Obviously, such a user should be
just ignored. But what if the circumstances are slightly different? What
if they're 2, 10 users? where's the line. It is possible that we can
never have a better definition than &quot;I know it when I see it&quot; [citation
needed].</p>
<h4 id="uncontroversial-softforks">Uncontroversial softforks</h4>
<p>If a majority of miners adopts a softfork, users will follow that chain,
even without understanding the new rules. For them is like if blocks are
created in a certain way or certain valid transactions are being
rejected by miners for some reason. For old nodes it just looks like the
new rules are policy rules rather than consensus rules. This greatly
reduces the deployment risks, making softforks the preferred consensus
rules upgrade mechanism.</p>
<p>The first precedent of a softfork was the introduction of P2SH
documented in BIP16. There were competing proposals, but BIP12 had clear
disadvantage and BIP17 was considered a less tested but functionally
equivalent version by most of the reviewers. Although it was later
discovered that BIP16 had unnecessary limitations and BIP17 is now
considered superior, this probably still qualified for our vague concept
of &quot;uncontroversial&quot;.</p>
<p>At the time, there was no &quot;mining voting&quot; implementation and it was
simply deployed using the timestamp of the blocks at some time in the
future as the activation trigger. This can't guarantee the assumption
that most miners have upgraded before enforcing the new rules and that's
why the voting mechanism and first used for BIP30 and BIP66. The current
voting threshold for softfork enforcement is 95%. There's also a 75%
threshold for miners to activate it as a policy rule, but it should be
safe for miners to activate such a policy from the start or later than
75%, as long as they enforce it as consensus rule after 95%.</p>
<p>The current miners' voting mechanism can be modified to allow for
changes to be deployed in parallel, the rejection of a concrete softfork
without getting locked for the deployment of the next one, and also a
more efficient use of the version field in block headers [3]. BIP65 is
expected to be deployed with the improved mechanism.</p>
<h4 id="uncontroversial-hardforks">Uncontroversial hardforks</h4>
<p>Some consensus changes require all participants to upgrade their
software before the new rules can be safely activated or they will face
serious risk of following the wrong chain and being defrauded. Even if
the exact same mechanism used for softforks would be more risky in these
cases, that doesn't mean that this type of changes cannot be deployed in
an uncontroversial and safe manner.</p>
<p>The simplest approach is to select a block height far enough in the
future that everybody has plenty of time to change their software. But
if you're aiming for universal adoption, that includes miners' adoption,
so it seems reasonable to use a mining voting on top of that. In this
case there's only one relevant threshold and it could be different from
the softfork one. Probably 100% is too strict, since it would allow a
relatively small miner to attack the network and block a consensus
upgrade. Something between 99% and 95% is probably a sensible choice for
this parameter.</p>
<h4 id="uncontroversial-emergency-hardforks">Uncontroversial emergency hardforks</h4>
<p>Emergency forks may not have time to consult miners and have to be
deployed simply by choosing a block height not so far in the future.</p>
<p>But emergency forks could be prepared ahead of time. For example, an
intermediary version of software could allow blocks that are double the
size of old blocks (after a certain height in the future) while still
making miners reject bigger blocks as a softfork rule. Then miners can
start the regular process for uncontroversial softfork (or a unilateral
softfork if they're a majority) at any point in the future if it is
required, and both intermediary and new versions would be prepared for
it (which would make deployment much easier). Other related consensus
changes could be deployed in the meantime (say, quadrupling the block
size) making the emergency softfork unnecessary.</p>
<h2 id="code">Code</h2>
<p>This BIP is complemented with a concrete code proposal[4] for an
uncontroversial hardfork which acts as a precedent and removes the
perception that hardforks are impossible in Bitcoin. The deployment of
the proposal should not block any other potential hardforks (thus it
will required the version bits proposal[3] to be implemented). The
change itself doesn't add much complexity to Bitcoin Core and is simple
enough that is trivial to apply to diverse implementations (that
currently can only use libbitcoinconsensus to validate script-related
rules). The change has been already widely tested in many altcoins.</p>
<p>The chosen consensus change is the fix of the timewarp attack discovered
and also fixed with a simple patch[5] by @ArtForz. This change has
been deployed by most altcoins that made any minimally meaningful change
to bitcoin and thus can be considered somewhat tested (in fact, most
SHA256d altcoins that didn't implement it have died or being forced to
implement it as an emergency hardfork). When deploying this change has
been discussed, usually arguments in the lines of &quot;if we get to the
point when this matters to bitcoin, we would be already in serious
trouble&quot; were used against it. This shouldn't be seen as a disadvantage
in this context, since it means we can safely activate the fix very far
away in the future (say, 4 years worth of blocks).</p>
