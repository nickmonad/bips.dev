</span></code></pre><h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>A method of altering the maximum allowed block size of the Bitcoin
protocol using a consensus based approach.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>There is a belief that Bitcoin cannot easily respond to raising the
blocksize limit if popularity was to suddenly increase due to a mass
adoption curve, because co-ordinating a hard fork takes considerable
time, and being unable to respond in a timely manner would irreparably
harm the credibility of bitcoin.</p>
<p>Additionally, predetermined block size increases are problematic because
they attempt to predict the future, and if too large could have
unintended consequences like damaging the possibility for a fee market
to develop as block subsidy decreases substantially over the next 9
years; introducing or exacerbating mining attack vectors; or somehow
affect the network in unknown or unpredicted ways. Since fixed changes
are hard to deploy, the damage could be extensive.</p>
<p>Dynamic block size adjustments also suffer from the potential to be
gamed by the larger hash power.</p>
<p>Free voting as suggested by BIP100 allows miners to sell their votes out
of band at no risk, and enable the sponsor the ability to manipulate the
blocksize. It also provides a cost free method or the larger pools to
vote in ways to manipulate the blocksize such to disadvantage or attack
smaller pools.</p>
<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>By introducing a cost to increase the block size ensures the mining
community will collude to increase it only when there is a clear
necessity, and reduce it when it is unnecessary. Larger miners cannot
force their wishes so easily because not only will they have to pay
extra a difficulty target, then can be downvoted at no cost by the
objecting hash power.</p>
<p>Using difficulty as a penalty is better than a fixed cost in bitcoins
because it is less predictable.</p>
<p>In order to prevent miners having complete control over blocksize, an
upper limit is required at protocol level. This feature ensures full
nodes retain control over consensus, remembering full nodes are the
mechanism to keep miners honest.</p>
<h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>
<p>The initial block size limit shall be 1MB.</p>
<p>Each time a miner creates a block, they may vote to increase or decrease
the blocksize by a maximum of 10% of the current block size limit. These
votes will be used to recalculate the new block size limit every 2016
blocks.</p>
<p>Votes are cast using the block's coinbase transaction scriptSig.</p>
<p>As per BIP34, the coinbase transaction scriptSig starts with a push of
the block height. The next push is a little-endian number representing
the preferred block size in bytes. For example, 0x4c(OP_PUSHDATA1)
0x03(size of constant) 0x80 0x84 0x1e(2MB) or 0x4c(OP_PUSHDATA1)
0x04(size of constant) 0x80 0x96 0x98 0x00(10MB).</p>
<p>If a miner votes for an increase, the block hash must meet a difficulty
target which is proportionally larger than the standard difficulty
target based on the percentage increase they voted for.</p>
<p>Votes proposing decreasing the block size limit do not need to meet a
higher difficulty target.</p>
<p>Miners can vote for no change by voting for the current block size.</p>
<p>For blocks to be valid the blockhash must meet the required difficulty
target for the vote otherwise the block is invalid and will be rejected.</p>
<p>Every 2016 blocks, the block size limit will be recalculated by the
median of all votes in the last 2016 blocks. This will redefine the
block size limit for the next 2016 blocks.</p>
<p>Blocks that are larger than the calculated base block size limit are
invalid and will be rejected.</p>
<p>The base block size limit may not reduce below 1MB or increase above 8MB
(the exact number for the upper limit requires further discussion).</p>
