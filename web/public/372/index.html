<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>This document proposes additional fields for BIP 174 PSBTv0 and BIP 370
PSBTv2 that allow for pay-to-contract key tweaking data data to be
included in a PSBT of any version. These will represent an
extra-transaction information required for the signer to produce valid
signatures spending previous outputs.</p>
<h3 id="copyright">Copyright</h3>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>Key tweaking is a procedure for creating a cryptographic commitment to
some message using elliptic curve properties. The procedure uses the
discrete log problem (DLP) to commit to an extra-transaction message.
This is done by adding to a public key (for which the output owner knows
the corresponding private key) a hash of the message multiplied on the
generator point G of the elliptic curve. This produces a tweaked public
key, containing the commitment. Later, in order to spend an output
containing P2C commitment, the same commitment should be added to the
corresponding private key.</p>
<p>This type of commitment was originally proposed as a part of the pay to
contract concept by Ilja Gerhardt and Timo Hanke in [1] and later used
by Eternity Wall [2] for the same purpose. Since that time multiple
different protocols for P2C has been developed, including OpenTimeStamps
[3], Elements sidechain P2C tweaks [4] and LNPBP-1 [5], used in
for constructing Peter Todd's single-use-seals [6] in
client-side-validation protocols like RGB.</p>
<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
<p>P2C outputs can be detected onchain and spent only if the output owner
not just knows the corresponding original private key, but also is aware
about P2C tweak applied to the public key. In order to produce a valid
signature, the same tweak value must be added (modulo group order) to
the original private key by a signer device. This represents a challenge
for external signers, which may not have any information about such
commitment. This proposal addresses this issue by adding relevant fields
to the PSBT input information.</p>
<p>The proposal abstracts details of specific P2C protocols and provides
universal method for spending previous outputs containing P2C tweaks,
applied to the public key contained within any standard form of the
<code>scriptPubkey</code>, including bare scripts and P2PK, P2PKH, P2SH, witness v0
P2WPKH, P2WSH, nested witness v0 P2WPKH-P2SH, P2WSH-P2SH and witness v1
P2TR outputs.</p>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p>P2C-tweaked public keys are already exposed in the
<code>PSBT_IN_REDEEM_SCRIPT</code>, <code>PSBT_IN_WITNESS_SCRIPT</code>,
<code>PSBT_IN_TAP_INTERNAL_KEY</code> and <code>PSBT_IN_TAP_LEAF_SCRIPT</code> fields; the
only information signer is needed to recognize which keys it should sign
with is from which of the original keys they were generated. This is
achieved by introducing new `PSBT_IN_P2C_TWEAK` field which has the
original key as a field key and the tweak as a field value. The signer
will recognize the keys which are available to it, apply the tweak to
them and see in which scripts it was used -- and use this information to
apply tweaks for the corresponding private keys and produce valid
signatures.</p>
<h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>
<p>The new per-input type is defined as follows:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th><keytype></th><th><keydata></th><th><keydata> Description</th><th><valuedata></th><th><valuedata> Description</th><th>Versions Requiring Inclusion</th><th>Versions Requiring Exclusion</th><th>Versions Allowing Inclusion</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>P2C Key Tweak</td><td><code>PSBT_IN_P2C_TWEAK = 0x19</code></td><td><pubkey></td><td>33 bytes of compact public key serialization specifying to which of keys the P2C tweak may be applied (i.e. this MUST be a value of a public key before the tweak is applied). BIP-340 keys are serialized by appending `02` byte.[1]</td><td><tweak></td><td>The 32 byte value which MUST be added to a private key to produce correct ECDSA and/or Schnorr signature (&quot;key tweak&quot;). Signers SHOULD remove this field after <code>PSBT_IN_PARTIAL_SIG</code> is constructed.</td><td></td><td></td><td>0, 2</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<h2 id="security-considerations">Security considerations</h2>
<p>The scope of this proposal is deliberately kept narrow; it addresses
only spending of transaction outputs containing P2C tweaks - and does
not addresses construction of a new P2C commitments or transactions
containing them in their outputs.[2]</p>
<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>
<references/>
<h2 id="compatibility">Compatibility</h2>
<p>The proposal is compatible with the existing consensus rules and does
not require any of their modifications.</p>
<p>The proposed P2C PSBT fields provides sufficient information for
creating a valid signatures for spendings of the following output types
containing tweaked public keys: - bare scripts, - P2PK, - P2PKH, - P2SH,</p>
<ul>
<li>witness v0 P2WPKH and P2WSH, - nested witness v0 P2WPKH-P2SH and
P2WSH-P2SH,</li>
</ul>
<p>Post-0 witness versions, including taproot outputs and future witness
versions, may not be supported or covered by this BIP and may require
addition of new fields to the PSBT inputs.</p>

<li><strong>Why compressed public keys are not distinguished from BIP-340
public keys</strong>We follow the logic of BIP32 key derivation which does
not performs that distinguishment. The type of the key is defined by
the input type, and adding additional PSBT field type will just
create the need for handling errors when the input type does not
match the provided key type.</li>
<li><strong>Why only spending of P2C tweaked outputs is covered</strong> P2C tweaks
commit to external data, some of which may represent certain value
(like in some sidechains, single-use-seal applications like RGB
etc). Creation of such outputs much allow hardware devices to
understand the structure of such extra-transaction data, which may
be in different formats and constantly involve. Thus, this should be
addresses with a separate standards (or be a vendor-based). The
current proposal only touches the question of spending an output
which contained previously created P2C commitment, which does not
creates a new commitment and does not provides that kind of risk of
extra-blockchain value loses.</li>
